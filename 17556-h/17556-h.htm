<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The following treatise on Sextus Empiricus and Greek Scepticism
has been prepared to supply a need much felt in the English
language by students of Greek philosophy. For while other schools
of Greek philosophy have been exhaustively and critically discussed
by English scholars, there are few sources of information available
to the student who wishes to make himself familiar with the
teachings of Pyrrhonism. The aim has been, accordingly, to give a
concise presentation of Pyrrhonism in relation to its historical
development and the Scepticism of the Academy, with critical
references to the French and German works existing on the subject.
The time and manner of the connection of Sextus Empiricus with the
Pyrrhonean School has also been discussed.</p>

<p>As the First Book of the <i>Hypotyposes</i>, or Pyrrhonic
Sketches by Sextus Empiricus, contains the substance of the
teachings of Pyrrhonism, it has been hoped that a translation of it
into English might prove a useful contribution to the literature on
Pyrrhonism, and this translation has been added to the critical
part of the work.</p>

<p>In making this translation, and in the general study of the
works of Sextus, the Greek text of Immanuel Bekker, Berlin, 1842,
has been used, with frequent consultation of the text of J.A.
Fabricius, 1718, which was taken directly from the existing
manuscripts of the works of Sextus. The divisions into chapters,
with the headings of the chapters in the translation, is the same
as Fabricius gives from the manuscripts, although not used by
Bekker, and the numbers of the paragraphs are the same as those
given by both Fabricius and Bekker. References to Diogenes Laertius
and other ancient works have been carefully verified.</p>

<div class="center"><i>The Historical Relations of Sextus
Empiricus.</i></div>

<p>Interest has revived in the works of Sextus Empiricus in recent
times, especially, one may say, since the date of Herbart. There is
much in the writings of Sextus that finds a parallel in the methods
of modern philosophy. There is a common starting-point in the study
of the power and limitations of human thought. There is a common
desire to investigate the phenomena of sense-perception, and the
genetic relations of man to the lower animals, and a common
interest in the theory of human knowledge.</p>

<p>While, however, some of the pages of Sextus' works would form a
possible introduction to certain lines of modern philosophical
thought, we cannot carry the analogy farther, for Pyrrhonism as a
whole lacked the essential element of all philosophical progress,
which is a belief in the possibility of finding and establishing
the truth in the subjects investigated.</p>

<p>Before beginning a critical study of the writings of Sextus
Empiricus, and the light which they throw on the development of
Greek Scepticism, it is necessary to make ourselves somewhat
familiar with the environment in which he lived and wrote. We shall
thus be able to comprehend more fully the standpoint from which he
regarded philosophical questions.</p>

<p>Let us accordingly attempt to give some details of his life,
including his profession, the time when he lived, the place of his
birth, the country in which he taught, and the general aim and
character of his works. Here, however, we encounter great
difficulties, for although we possess most of the writings of
Sextus well preserved, the evidence which they provide on the
points mentioned is very slight. He does not give us biographical
details in regard to himself, nor does he refer to his
contemporaries in a way to afford any exact knowledge of them. His
name even furnishes us with a problem impossible of solution. He is
called &Sigma;&#8051;&xi;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; &#8001;
&#7952;&mu;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;
by Diogenes Laertius<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" /> <a
href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>:

&#7952;&mu;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&kappa;&#8056;&sigmaf;
&kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &alpha;&#8016;&tau;&#972;&sigmaf;. Although
in this passage Diogenes speaks of Sextus the second time without
the surname, we cannot understand the meaning otherwise than that
Diogenes considered Sextus a physician of the Empirical School.
Other evidence also is not wanting that Sextus bore this surname.
Fabricius, in his edition of the works of Sextus, quotes from the
<i>Tabella de Sectis Medicorum</i> of Lambecius the statement that
Sextus was called Empiricus because of his position in medicine.<a
name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" /><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Pseudo-Galen also refers to him as one of the directors of the
Empirical School, and calls him
&Sigma;&#8051;&xi;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; &#8001;
&#7952;&mu;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#972;&sigmaf;. <a
name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3" /><a href="#Footnote_3_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> His name is often found in the manuscripts
written with the surname, as for example at the end of <i>Logic
II</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4" /><a href=
"#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In other places it is
found written without the surname, as Fabricius testifies, where
Sextus is mentioned as a Sceptic in connection with Pyrrho.</p>

</div>

<p>The Sceptical School was long closely connected with the
Empirical School of medicine, and the later Pyrrhoneans, when they
were physicians, as was often the case, belonged for the most part
to this school. Menedotus of Nicomedia is the first Sceptic,
however, who is formally spoken of as an Empirical physician,<a
name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5" /><a href="#Footnote_1_5"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and his contemporary Theodas of Laodicea
was also an Empirical physician. The date of Menedotus and Theodas
is difficult to fix, but Brochard and Hass agree that it was about
150 A.D.<a name="FNanchor_2_6" id="FNanchor_2_6" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_6" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> After the time of these
two physicians, who were also each in turn at the head of the
Sceptical School,<a name="FNanchor_3_7" id="FNanchor_3_7" /><a
href="#Footnote_3_7" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> there seems to have
been a definite alliance between Pyrrhonism and Empiricism in
medicine, and we have every reason to believe that this alliance
existed until the time of Sextus.</p>

</div>

<p>The difficulty in regard to the name arises from Sextus' own
testimony. In the first book of the <i>Hypotyposes</i> he takes
strong ground against the identity of Pyrrhonism and Empiricism in
medicine. Although he introduces his objections with the admission
that "some say that they are the same," in recognition of the close
union that had existed between them, he goes on to say that
"Empiricism is neither Scepticism itself, nor would it suit the
Sceptic to take that sect upon himself",<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id=
"FNanchor_1_8" /><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
for the reason that Empiricism maintains dogmatically the
impossibility of knowledge, but he would prefer to belong to the
Methodical School, which was the only medical school worthy of the
Sceptic. "For this alone of all the medical sects, does not proceed
rashly it seems to me, in regard to unknown things, and does not
presume to say whether they are comprehensible or not, but it is
guided by phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_2_9" id="FNanchor_2_9" /><a
href="#Footnote_2_9" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It will thus be seen
that the Methodical School of medicine has a certain relationship
to Scepticism which is closer than that of the other medical
sects."<a name="FNanchor_3_10" id="FNanchor_3_10" /><a href=

<p>We know from the testimony of Sextus himself that he was a
physician. In one case he uses the first person for himself as a
physician,<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and in another he speaks
of Asclepius as "the founder of our science,"<a name=
"FNanchor_2_12" id="FNanchor_2_12" /><a href="#Footnote_2_12"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and all his illustrations show a breadth
and variety of medical knowledge that only a physician could
possess. He published a medical work which he refers to once as
&#7984;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#8048;

<p>In apparent contradiction to his statement in <i>Hypotyposes</i>
I., that Scepticism and Empiricism are opposed to each other, in
that Empiricism denies the possibility of knowledge, and Scepticism
makes no dogmatic statements of any kind, Sextus classes the
Sceptics and Empiricists together in another instance, as regarding
knowledge as impossible<a name="FNanchor_6_16" id=

<p>Pappenheim thinks that Sextus belonged to the Methodical School,
both from his strong expression in favor of that school in
<i>Hyp</i>. I. 236, as above, and also because many of his medical
opinions, as found in his works, agree with the teachings of the
Methodical School, more nearly than with those of the Empiricists.
Pappenheim also claims that we find no inconsistency with this view
in the passage given where Sextus classes the Sceptics with the
Empiricists, but considers that statement an instance of
carelessness in expressing himself, on the part of Sextus.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18" /><a href="#Footnote_1_18"

</div>

<p>The position of Pappenheim is assailable for the reason that in
dealing with any problem regarding an author on the basis of
internal evidence, we have no right to consider one of his
statements worthy of weight, and another one unworthy, on the
supposition that he expressed himself carelessly in the second
instance. Rather must we attempt to find his true standpoint by
fairly meeting all the difficulties offered in apparently
conflicting passages. This has been attempted by Zeller, Brochard,
Natorp and others, with the general result that all things
considered they think without doubt that Sextus belonged to the
Empirical School.<a name="FNanchor_1_19" id="FNanchor_1_19" /><a
href="#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His other references
are too strong to allow his fidelity to it to be doubted. He is
called one of the leaders of Empiricism by Pseudo-Galen, and his
only medical work bore the title
&#7952;&mu;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#8048;
&#8017;&pi;&omicron;&mu;&nu;&#942;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;. The
opinion of the writers above referred to is that the passage which
we have quoted from the <i>Hypotyposes</i> does not necessarily
mean that Sextus was not an Empiricist, but as he was more of a
Sceptic than a physician, he gave preference to those doctrines
that were most consistent with Scepticism, and accordingly claimed
that it was not absolutely necessary that a Sceptic physician
should be an Empiricist. Natorp considers that the different
standpoint from which Sextus judges the Empirical and Methodical
Schools in his different works is accounted for on the supposition
that he was an Empiricist, but disagreed with that school on the
one point only.<a name="FNanchor_2_20" id="FNanchor_2_20" /><a
href="#Footnote_2_20" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Natorp points out
that Sextus does not speak more favourably of the medical stand of
the Methodical School, but only compares the way in which both
schools regarded the question of the possibility of knowledge, and
thinks that Sextus could have been an Empiricist as a physician
notwithstanding his condemnation of the attitude of the Empirical
School in relation to the theory of knowledge. This difference
between the two schools was a small one, and on a subtle and
unimportant point; in fact, a difference in philosophical theory,
and not in medical practice.</p>

<p>While we would agree with the authors above referred to, that
Sextus very probably recognized the bond between the Empirical
School of medicine and Pyrrhonism, yet to make his possible
connection with that school the explanation of his name, gives him
more prominence as a physician than is consistent with what we know
of his career. The long continued union of Empiricism and
Scepticism would naturally support the view that Sextus was, at
least during the earlier part of his life, a physician of that
school, and yet it may be that he was not named Empiricus for that
reason. There is one instance in ancient writings where Empiricus
is known as a simple proper name.<a name="FNanchor_1_21" id=
"FNanchor_1_21" /><a href="#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It may have been a proper name in Sextus' case, or there are many
other ways in which it could have originated, as those who have
studied the origin of names will readily grant, perhaps indeed,
from the title of the above-named work,
&#7952;&mu;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#8048;
&#8017;&pi;&omicron;&mu;&nu;&#942;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;. The
chief argument for this view of the case is that there were other
leaders of the Sceptical School, for whom we can claim far greater
influence as Empiricists than for Sextus, and for whom the surname
Empiricus would have been more appropriate, if it was given in
consequence of prominence in the Empirical School. Sextus is known
to the world as a Sceptic, and not as a physician. He was classed
in later times with Pyrrho, and his philosophical works survived,
while his medical writings did not, but are chiefly known from his
own mention of them. Moreover, the passage which we have quoted
from the <i>Hypotyposes</i> is too strong to allow us easily to
believe that Sextus remained all his life a member of the Empirical
School. He could hardly have said, "Nor would it suit the Sceptic
to take that sect upon himself," if he at the same time belonged to
it. His other references to the Empirical School, of a more
favorable character, can be easily explained on the ground of the
long continued connection which had existed between the two
schools. It is quite possible to suppose that Sextus was an
Empiricist a part of his life, and afterwards found the Methodical
School more to his liking, and such a change would not in any way
have affected his stand as a physician.</p>

<p>In regard to the exact time when Sextus Empiricus lived, we gain
very little knowledge from internal evidence, and outside sources
of information are equally uncertain. Diogenes Laertius must have
been a generation younger than Sextus, as he mentions the disciple
of Sextus, Saturninus, as an Empirical physician.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_22" id="FNanchor_1_22" /><a href="#Footnote_1_22"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The time of Diogenes is usually estimated
as the first half of the third century A.D.,<a name="FNanchor_2_23"
id="FNanchor_2_23" /><a href="#Footnote_2_23" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> therefore Sextus cannot be brought forward later
than the beginning of the century. Sextus, however, directs his
writings entirely against the Dogmatics, by whom he distinctly
states that he means the Stoics,<a name="FNanchor_3_24" id=
"FNanchor_3_24" /><a href="#Footnote_3_24" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and the influence of the Stoics began to decline in the beginning
of the third century A.D. A fact often used as a help in fixing the
date of Sextus is his mention of Basilides the Stoic, <a name=
"FNanchor_4_25" id="FNanchor_4_25" /><a href="#Footnote_4_25"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> &#7936;&lambda;&lambda;&#8048;
&kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &omicron;&#7985;
&sigma;&tau;&omega;&#970;&kappa;&omicron;&#943;, &#974;&sigmaf;
&omicron;&#943; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054;
&Beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&#943;&delta;&eta;&nu;.
This Basilides was supposed to be identical with one of the
teachers of Marcus Aurelius.<a name="FNanchor_5_26" id=
"FNanchor_5_26" /><a href="#Footnote_5_26" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
This is accepted by Zeller in the second edition of his <i>History
of Philosophy</i>, but not in the third for the reason that Sextus,
in all the work from which this reference is taken, <i>i.e.
Math</i>. VII.&mdash;XI., mentions no one besides Aenesidemus, who
lived later than the middle of the last century B.C.<a name=
"FNanchor_6_27" id="FNanchor_6_27" /><a href="#Footnote_6_27"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The Basilides referred to by Sextus may be
one mentioned in a list of twenty Stoics, in a fragment of Diogenes
Laertius, recently published in Berlin by Val Rose.<a name=
"FNanchor_7_28" id="FNanchor_7_28" /><a href="#Footnote_7_28"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Too much importance has, however, been
given to the relation of the mention of Basilides the Stoic to the
question of the date of Sextus. Even if the Basilides referred to
by Sextus is granted to have been the teacher of Marcus Aurelius,
it only serves to show that Sextus lived either at the same time
with Marcus Aurelius or after him, which is a conclusion that we
must in any case reach for other reasons.</p>

<p>The fact that has caused the greatest uncertainty in regard to
the date of Sextus is that Claudius Galen in his works mentions
several Sceptics who were also physicians of the Empirical
School,<a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_29" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and often speaks of
Herodotus, supposed to be identical with the teacher of Sextus
given by Diogenes Laertius,<a name="FNanchor_2_30" id=
"FNanchor_2_30" /><a href="#Footnote_2_30" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
but makes no reference whatever to Sextus. As Galen's time passes
the limit of the second century A.D., we must either infer that
Sextus was not the well-known physician that he was stated to be by
Pseudo-Galen, and consequently not known to Galen, or that Galen
wrote before Sextus became prominent as a Sceptic. This silence on
the part of Galen in regard to Sextus increases the doubt, caused
by Sextus' own criticism of the Empirical School of medicine, as to
his having been an Empiricist. The question is made more
complicated, as it is difficult to fix the identity of the
Herodotus so often referred to by Galen.<a name="FNanchor_3_31" id=
"FNanchor_3_31" /><a href="#Footnote_3_31" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
As Galen died about 200 A.D. at the age of seventy,<a name=
"FNanchor_4_32" id="FNanchor_4_32" /><a href="#Footnote_4_32"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> we should fix the date of Sextus early in
the third century, and that of Diogenes perhaps a little later than
the middle, were it not that early in the third century the Stoics
began to decline in influence, and could hardly have excited the
warmth of animosity displayed by Sextus. We must then suppose that
Sextus wrote at the very latter part of the second century, and
either that Galen did not know him, or that Galen's books were
published before Sextus became prominent either as a physician or
as a Sceptic. The fact that he may have been better known as the
latter than as the former does not sufficiently account for Galen's
silence, as other Sceptics are mentioned by him of less importance
than Sextus, and the latter, even if not as great a physician as
Pseudo-Galen asserts, was certainly both a Sceptic and a physician,
and must have belonged to one of the two medical schools so
thoroughly discussed by Galen&mdash;either the Empirical or the
Methodical. Therefore, if Sextus were a contemporary of Galen, he
was so far removed from the circle of Galen's acquaintances as to
have made no impression upon him, either as a Sceptic or a
physician, a supposition that is very improbable. We must then fix
the date of Sextus late in the second century, and conclude that
the climax of his public career was reached after Galen had
finished those of his writings which are still extant.</p>

<p>Sextus has a Latin name, but he was a Greek; we know this from
his own statement.<a name="FNanchor_1_33" id="FNanchor_1_33" /><a
href="#Footnote_1_33" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We also know that he
must have been a Greek from the beauty and facility of his style,
and from his acquaintance with Greek dialects. The place of his
birth can only, however, be conjectured, from arguments indirectly
derived from his writings. His constant references throughout his
works to the minute customs of different nations ought to give us a
clue to the solution of this question, but strange to say they do
not give us a decided one. Of these references a large number,
however, relate to the customs of Libya, showing a minute knowledge
in regard to the political and religious customs of this land that
he displays in regard to no other country except Egypt.<a name=
"FNanchor_2_34" id="FNanchor_2_34" /><a href="#Footnote_2_34"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Fabricius thinks Libya was not his birth
place because of a reference which he makes to it in the

This conclusion is, however, entirely unfounded, as the explanation
of Sextus simply shows that the people whom he was then addressing
were not familiar with the nations of Libya. Suidas speaks of two
men called Sextus, one from Ch&aelig;ronea and one from Libya, both
of whom he calls Sceptics, and to one of whom he attributes Sextus'
books. All authorities agree in asserting that great confusion
exists in the works of Suidas; and Fabricius, Zeller, and
Pappenheim place no weight upon this testimony of Suidas.<a name=
"FNanchor_4_36" id="FNanchor_4_36" /><a href="#Footnote_4_36"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Haas, however, contends<a name=
"FNanchor_5_37" id="FNanchor_5_37" /><a href="#Footnote_5_37"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that it is unreasonable to suppose that
this confusion could go as far as to attribute the writings of
Sextus Empiricus to Sextus of Ch&aelig;ronea, and also make the
latter a Sceptic, and he considers it far more reasonable to accept
the testimony of Suidas, as it coincides so well with the internal
evidence of Sextus' writings in regard to his native land. It is
nevertheless evident, from his familiarity with the customs,
language, and laws of Athens, Alexandria and Rome, that he must
have resided at some time in each of these cities.</p>

<p>Of all the problems connected with the historical details of the
life of Sextus, the one that is the most difficult of solution, and
also the most important for our present purpose of making a
critical study of his teaching, is to fix the seat of the Sceptical
School during the time that he was in charge of it. The
<i>Hypotyposes</i> are lectures delivered in public in that period
of his life. Where then were they delivered? We know that the
Sceptical School must have had a long continued existence as a
definite philosophical movement, although some have contended
otherwise. The fact of its existence as an organized direction of
thought, is demonstrated by its formulated teachings, and the list
given by Diogenes Laertius of its principal leaders,<a name=

<p>This was after the dogmatic tendency of the Academy under
Antiochus and his followers had driven Pyrrhonism from the partial
union with the Academy, which it had experienced after the breaking
up of the school under the immediate successors of Timon.
Aenesidemus taught about the time of our era in Alexandria, and
established the school there anew; and his followers are spoken of
in a way that presupposes their continuing in the same place. There
is every reason to think that the connection of Sextus with
Alexandria was an intimate one, not only because Alexandria had
been for so long a time the seat of Pyrrhonism, but also from
internal evidence from his writings and their subsequent historical
influence; and yet the <i>Hypotyposes</i> could not have been
delivered in Alexandria, as he often refers to that place in
comparison with the place where he was then speaking. He says,
furthermore, that he teaches in the same place where his master
taught.<a name="FNanchor_1_44" id="FNanchor_1_44" /><a href=

Therefore the school must have been removed from Alexandria, in or
before the time of the teacher of Sextus, to some other centre. The
<i>Hypotyposes</i> are from beginning to end a direct attack on the
Dogmatics; therefore Sextus must have taught either in some city
where the dogmatic philosophy was strong, or in some rival
philosophical centre. The <i>Hypotyposes</i> show also that the
writer had access to some large library. Alexandria, Rome and
Athens are the three places the most probable for selection for
such a purpose. For whatever reason the seat of the school was
removed from Alexandria by the master of Sextus, or by himself,
from the place where it had so long been united with the Empirical
School of medicine, Athens would seem the most suitable city for
its recontinuance, in the land where Pyrrhonism first had its
birth. Sextus, however, in one instance, in referring to things
invisible because of their outward relations, says in illustration,
"as the city of Athens is invisible to us at present."<a name=
"FNanchor_2_45" id="FNanchor_2_45" /><a href="#Footnote_2_45"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In other places also he contrasts the
Athenians with the people whom he is addressing, equally with the
Alexandrians, thus putting Athens as well as Alexandria out of the
question.</p>

<p>Of the different writers on Sextus Empiricus, those who have
treated this part of the subject most critically are Haas and
Pappenheim. We will therefore consider, somewhat at length, the
results presented by these two authors. Haas thinks that the
<i>Hypotyposes</i> were delivered in Rome for the following
reasons. Sextus' lectures must have been given in some centre of
philosophical schools and of learning. He never opposes Roman
relations to those of the place where he is speaking, as he does in
regard to Athens and Alexandria. He uses the name "Romans" only
three times,<a name="FNanchor_1_46" id="FNanchor_1_46" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_46" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> once comparing them to
the Rhodians, once to the Persians, and once in general to other
nations.<a name="FNanchor_2_47" id="FNanchor_2_47" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_47" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In the first two of these
references, the expression "among the Romans" in the first part of
the antithesis is followed by the expression, "among us," in the
second part, which Haas understands to be synonymous. The third
reference is in regard to a Roman law, and the use of the word
'Roman' does not at all show that Sextus was not then in Rome. The
character of the laws referred to by Sextus as
&pi;&alpha;&rho;&#8125; &#7969;&mu;&#8150;&nu; shows that they were
always Roman laws, and his definition of law<a name="FNanchor_3_48"
id="FNanchor_3_48" /><a href="#Footnote_3_48" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> is especially a definition of Roman law. This
argument might, it would seem, apply to any part of the Roman
Empire, but Haas claims that the whole relation of law to custom as
treated of by Sextus, and all his statements of customs forbidden
at that time by law, point to Rome as the place of his residence.
Further, Haas considers the Herodotus mentioned by Galen<a name=
"FNanchor_4_49" id="FNanchor_4_49" /><a href="#Footnote_4_49"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as a prominent physician in Rome, to have
been the predecessor and master of Sextus, in whose place Sextus
says that he is teaching.<a name="FNanchor_5_50" id=
"FNanchor_5_50" /><a href="#Footnote_5_50" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Haas also thinks that Sextus' refutation of the identity of
Pyrrhonism with Empiricism evidently refers to a paragraph in
Galen's <i>Subfiguratio Empirica</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_51" id=
"FNanchor_6_51" /><a href="#Footnote_6_51" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
which would be natural if the <i>Hypotyposes</i> were written
shortly after Galen's <i>Sub. Em.</i>, and in the same place.
Further, Hippolytus, who wrote in or near Rome very soon after the
time of Sextus, apparently used the <i>Hypotyposes</i>, which would
be more natural if he wrote in the same place. According to Haas,
every thing in internal evidence, and outward testimony, points to
Rome as having been the city where Sextus occupied his position as
the head of the Sceptical School.</p>

<p>Coming now to the position of Pappenheim on this subject, we
find that he takes very decided ground against the seat of the
Sceptical School having been in Rome, even for a short time, in his
latest publication regarding it.<a name="FNanchor_1_52" id=
"FNanchor_1_52" /><a href="#Footnote_1_52" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
This opinion is the result of late study on the part of Pappenheim,
for in his work on the <i>Lebensverh&auml;ltnisse des Sextus
Empiricus</i> Berlin 1875, he says, "Dass Herodotus in Rom lebte
sagt Galen. Vermuthlich auch Sextus." His reasons given in the
later article for not connecting the Sceptical School at all with
Rome are as follows. He finds no proof of the influence of
Scepticism in Rome, as Cicero remarks that Pyrrhonism is extinct,<a
name="FNanchor_2_53" id="FNanchor_2_53" /><a href="#Footnote_2_53"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and he also gives weight to the well-known
sarcastic saying of Seneca, <i>Quis est qui tradat praecepta
Pyrrhonis!</i><a name="FNanchor_3_54" id="FNanchor_3_54" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_54" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> While Haas claims that
Sextus would naturally seek one of the centres of dogmatism, in
order most effectively to combat it, Pappenheim, on the contrary,
contends that it would have been foolishness on the part of Sextus
to think of starting the Sceptical School in Rome, where Stoicism
was the favored philosophy of the Roman Emperors; and when either
for the possible reason of strife between the Empirical and
Methodical Schools, or for some other cause, the Pyrrhonean School
was removed from Alexandria, Pappenheim claims that all testimony
points to the conclusion that it was founded in some city of the
East. The name of Sextus is never known in Roman literature, but in
the East, on the contrary, literature speaks for centuries of
Sextus and Pyrrho. The <i>Hypotyposes</i>, especially, were
well-known in the East, and references to Sextus are found there in
philosophical and religious dogmatic writings. The Emperor Julian
makes use of the works of Sextus, and he is frequently quoted by
the Church Fathers of the Eastern Church.<a name="FNanchor_4_55"
id="FNanchor_4_55" /><a href="#Footnote_4_55" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> Pappenheim accordingly concludes that the seat
of Pyrrhonism after the school was removed from Alexandria, was in
some unknown city of the East.</p>

</div>

<p>In estimating the weight of these arguments, we must accept with
Pappenheim the close connection of Pyrrhonism with Alexandria, and
the subsequent influence which it exerted upon the literature of
the East. All historical relations tend to fix the permanent seat
of Pyrrhonism, after its separation from the Academy, in
Alexandria. There is nothing to point to its removal from
Alexandria before the time of Menodotus, who is the teacher of
Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_1_56" id="FNanchor_1_56" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and for many reasons to
be considered the real teacher of Sextus. It was Menodotus who
perfected the Empirical doctrines, and who brought about an
official union between Scepticism and Empiricism, and who gave
Pyrrhonism in great measure, the <i>&eacute;clat</i> that it
enjoyed in Alexandria, and who appears to have been the most
powerful influence in the school, from the time of Aenesidemus to
that of Sextus. Furthermore, Sextus' familiarity with Alexandrian
customs bears the imprint of original knowledge, and he cannot, as
Zeller implies, be accepted as simply quoting. One could hardly
agree with Zeller,<a name="FNanchor_2_57" id="FNanchor_2_57" /><a
href="#Footnote_2_57" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that the familiarity
shown by Sextus with the customs of both Alexandria and Rome in the
<i>Hypotyposes</i> does not necessarily show that he ever lived in
either of those places, because a large part of his works are
compilations from other books; but on the contrary, the careful
reader of Sextus' works must find in all of them much evidence of
personal knowledge of Alexandria, Athens and Rome.</p>

<p>A part of Sextus' books also may have been written in
Alexandria. &Pi;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf;

If these were also lectures, then Sextus taught in Alexandria as
well as elsewhere. The history of Eastern literature for the
centuries immediately following the time of Sextus, showing as it
does in so many instances the influence of Pyrrhonism, and a
knowledge of the <i>Hypotyposes</i>, furnishes us with an
incontestable proof that the school could not have been for a long
time removed from the East, and the absence of such knowledge in
Roman literature is also a strong argument against its long
continuance in that city. It would seem, however, from all the data
at command, that during the years that the Sceptical School was
removed from Alexandria, its head quarters were in Rome, and that
the Pyrrhonean <i>Hypotyposes</i> were delivered in Rome. Let us
briefly consider the arguments in favour of such a hypothesis.
Scepticism was not unknown in Rome. Pappenheim quotes the remark of
Cicero that Pyrrhonism was long since dead, and the sarcasm of
Seneca, <i>Quis est qui tradat praecepta Pyrrhonis?</i> as an
argument against the knowledge of Pyrrhonism in Rome. We must
remember, however, that in Cicero's time Aenesidemus had not yet
separated himself from the Academy; or if we consider the Lucius
Tubero to whom Aenesidemus dedicated his works, as the same Lucius
Tubero who was the friend of Cicero in his youth, and accordingly
fix the date of Aenesidemus about 50 B.C.,<a name="FNanchor_2_59"
id="FNanchor_2_59" /><a href="#Footnote_2_59" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> even then Aenesidemus' work in Alexandria was
too late to have necessarily been known to Cicero, whose remark
must have been referred to the old school of Scepticism. Should we
grant, however, that the statements of Cicero and Seneca prove that
in their time Pyrrhonism was extinct in Rome, they certainly do not
show that after their death it could not have again revived, for
the <i>Hypotyposes</i> were delivered more than a century after the
death of Seneca. There are very few writers in Aenesidemus' own
time who showed any influence of his teachings.<a name=
"FNanchor_3_60" id="FNanchor_3_60" /><a href="#Footnote_3_60"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This influence was felt later, as
Pyrrhonism became better known. That Pyrrhonism received some
attention in Rome before the time of Sextus is nevertheless
demonstrated by the teachings of Favorinus there. Although
Favorinus was known as an Academician, the title of his principal
work was &tau;&omicron;&#8058;&sigmaf;

teaching and writing. His date is fixed by Zeller at 80-150 A.D.,
therefore Pyrrhonism was known in Rome shortly before the time of
Sextus.</p>

<p>The whole tone of the <i>Hypotyposes</i>, with the constant
references to the Stoics as living present opponents, shows that
these lectures must have been delivered in one of the centres of
Stoicism. As Alexandria and Athens are out of the question, all
testimony points to Rome as having been the seat of the Pyrrhonean
School, for at least a part of the time that Sextus was at its
head. We would then accept the teacher of Sextus, in whose place he
says he taught, as the Herodotus so often referred to by Galen<a
name="FNanchor_1_63" id="FNanchor_1_63" /><a href="#Footnote_1_63"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who lived in Rome. Sextus' frequent
references to Asclepiades, whom he mentions ten different times by
name in his works,<a name="FNanchor_2_64" id="FNanchor_2_64" /><a
href="#Footnote_2_64" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> speak in favour of
Rome in the matter under discussion, as Asclepiades made that city
one of the centres of medical culture. On the other hand, the fact
that there is no trace of the <i>Hypotyposes</i> in later Roman
literature, with the one exception of the works of Hippolytus, as
opposed to the wide-spread knowledge of them shown in the East for
centuries, is incontestable historical proof that the Sceptical
School could not long have had its seat at Rome. From the two
passages given above from Sextus' work against physics, he must
either have written that book in Alexandria, it would seem, or have
quoted those passages from some other work. May we not then
conclude, that Sextus was at the head of the school in Rome for a
short time, where it may have been removed temporarily, on account
of the difficulty with the Empiricists, implied in <i>Hyp</i>. I.
236-241, or in order to be better able to attack the Stoics, but
that he also taught in Alexandria, where the real home of the
school was certainly found? There it probably came to an end about
fifty years after the time of Sextus, and from that centre the
Sceptical works of Sextus had their wide-spread influence in the
East.</p>

<p>The books of Sextus Empiricus furnish us with the best and
fullest presentation of ancient Scepticism which has been preserved
to modern times, and give Sextus the position of one of the
greatest men of the Sceptical School. His works which are still
extant are the <i>Pyrrhonean Hypotyposes</i> in three volumes, and
the two works comprising eleven books which have been united in
later times under the title of &pi;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf;
&mu;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&#973;&sigmaf;,
one of which is directed against the sciences in general, and the
other against the dogmatic philosophers. The six books composing
the first of these are written respectively against grammarians,
rhetoricians, geometricians, arithmeticians, astronomers and
musicians. The five books of the latter consist of two against the
logicians, two against physics, and one against systems of morals.
If the last short work of the first book directed against the
arithmeticians is combined with the one preceding against the
geometricians, as it well could be, the two works together would be
divided into ten different parts; there is evidence to show that in
ancient times such a division was made.<a name="FNanchor_1_65" id=

There were two other works of Sextus which are now lost, the
medical work before referred to, and a book entitled
&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &psi;&upsilon;&chi;&#8134;&sigmaf;. The
character of the extant works of Sextus is similar, as they are all
directed either against science or against the dogmatics, and they
all present the negative side of Pyrrhonism. The vast array of
arguments comprising the subject-matter, often repeated in the same
and different forms, are evidently taken largely from the Sceptical
works which Sextus had resource to, and are, in fact, a summing up
of all the wisdom of the Sceptical School. The style of these books
is fluent, and the Greek reminds one of Plutarch and Thucydides,
and although Sextus does not claim originality, but presents in all
cases the arguments of the Sceptic, yet the illustrations and the
form in which the arguments are presented, often bear the marks of
his own thought, and are characterized here and there by a wealth
of humor that has not been sufficiently noticed in the critical
works on Sextus. Of all the authors who have reviewed Sextus,
Brochard is the only one who seems to have understood and
appreciated his humorous side.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to the consideration of the general
position and aim of Pyrrhonism.</p>

<div class="center"><i>The Position and Aim of
Pyrrhonism</i>.</div>

<p>The first volume of the <i>Pyrrhonean Hypotyposes</i> gives the
most complete statement found in any of the works of Sextus
Empiricus of the teachings of Pyrrhonism and its relation to other
schools of philosophy. The chief source of the subject-matter
presented is a work of the same name by Aenesidemus,<a name=
"FNanchor_1_66" id="FNanchor_1_66" /><a href="#Footnote_1_66"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> either directly used by Sextus, or through
the writings of those who followed Aenesidemus. The comprehensive
title
&Pi;&upsilon;&#8164;&#8165;&#974;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&iota;
&#8017;&pi;&omicron;&tau;&upsilon;&pi;&#974;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;
was very probably used in general to designate courses of lectures
given by the leaders of the Sceptical School.</p>

<p>In the opening chapters of the <i>Hypotyposes</i> Sextus
undertakes to define the position and aim of Pyrrhonism.<a name=
"FNanchor_2_67" id="FNanchor_2_67" /><a href="#Footnote_2_67"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In introducing his subject he treats
briefly of the differences between philosophical schools, dividing
them into three classes; those which claim that they have found the
truth, like the schools of Aristotle and Epicurus and the Stoics;
those which deny the possibility of finding it, like that of the
Academicians; and those that still seek it, like the Sceptical
School. The accusation against the Academicians, that they denied
the possibility of finding the truth, was one that the Sceptics
were very fond of making. We shall discuss the justice of it later,
simply remarking here, that to affirm the "incomprehensibility of
the unknown," was a form of expression that the Pyrrhonists
themselves were sometimes betrayed into, notwithstanding their
careful avoidance of dogmatic statements.<a name="FNanchor_3_68"

<p>After defining the three kinds of philosophy as the Dogmatic,
the Academic and the Sceptic, Sextus reminds his hearers that he
does not speak dogmatically in anything that he says, but that he
intends simply to present the Sceptical arguments historically, and
as they appear to him. He characterizes his treatment of the
subject as general rather than critical, including a statement of
the character of Scepticism, its idea, its principles, its manner
of reasoning, its criterion and aim, and a presentation of the
Tropes, or aspects of doubt, and the Sceptical formulae and the
distinction between Scepticism and the related schools of
philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_1_69" id="FNanchor_1_69" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_69" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The result of all the gradual changes which the development of
thought had brought about in the outward relations of the Sceptical
School, was to increase the earnestness of the claim of the
Sceptics to be simply followers of Pyrrho, the great founder of the
movement. In discussing the names given to the Sceptics, Sextus
gives precedence very decidedly to the title "Pyrrhonean," because
Pyrrho appears the best representative of Scepticism, and more
prominent than all who before him occupied themselves with it.<a
name="FNanchor_2_70" id="FNanchor_2_70" /><a href="#Footnote_2_70"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It was a question much discussed among philosophers in ancient
times, whether Pyrrhonism should be considered a philosophical sect
or not. Thus we find that Hippobotus in his work entitled
&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054;
&alpha;&#7985;&rho;&#8051;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&nu;, written
shortly before our era, does not include Pyrrhonism among the other
sects.<a name="FNanchor_3_71" id="FNanchor_3_71" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_71" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Diogenes himself, after
some hesitation remarking that many do not consider it a sect,
finally decides to call it so.<a name="FNanchor_4_72" id=

<p>Sextus in discussing this subject calls Scepticism an
&#7936;&gamma;&omega;&gamma;&#942;, or a movement, rather than a
&alpha;&#7989;&rho;&epsilon;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;, saying that
Scepticism is not a sect, if that word implies a systematic
arrangement of dogmas, for the Sceptic has no dogmas. If, however,
a sect may mean simply the following of a certain system of
reasoning according to what appears to be true, then Scepticism is
a sect.<a name="FNanchor_1_73" id="FNanchor_1_73" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_73" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> From a quotation given
later on by Sextus from Aenesidemus, we know that the latter used
the term &#7936;&gamma;&omega;&gamma;&#942;.<a name="FNanchor_2_74"
id="FNanchor_2_74" /><a href="#Footnote_2_74" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> Sextus gives also the other titles, so well
known as having been applied to Scepticism, namely,
&zeta;&eta;&tau;&eta;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#942;,
&#7952;&#981;&epsilon;&kappa;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#942;, and
&#7936;&pi;&omicron;&rho;&eta;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#942;.<a name=

class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The
&delta;&#973;&nu;&alpha;&mu;&iota;&sigmaf;<a name="FNanchor_4_76"
id="FNanchor_4_76" /><a href="#Footnote_4_76" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> of Scepticism is to oppose the things of sense
and intellect in every possible way to each other, and through the
equal weight of things opposed, or
&#7984;&sigma;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&#8051;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;,
to reach first the state of suspension of judgement, and afterwards
ataraxia, or "repose and tranquillity of soul."<a name=
"FNanchor_5_77" id="FNanchor_5_77" /><a href="#Footnote_5_77"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The purpose of Scepticism is then the hope
of ataraxia, and its origin was in the troubled state of mind
induced by the inequality of things, and uncertainty in regard to
the truth. Therefore, says Sextus, men of the greatest talent began
the Sceptical system by placing in opposition to every argument an
equal one, thus leading to a philosophical system without a dogma,
for the Sceptic claims that he has no dogma.<a name="FNanchor_6_78"
id="FNanchor_6_78" /><a href="#Footnote_6_78" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> The Sceptic is never supposed to state a decided
opinion, but only to say what appears to him. Even the Sceptical
formulae, such as "Nothing more,"<a name="FNanchor_7_79" id=
"FNanchor_7_79" /><a href="#Footnote_7_79" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
or "I decide nothing,"<a name="FNanchor_8_80" id=
"FNanchor_8_80" /><a href="#Footnote_8_80" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
or "All is false," include themselves with other things. The only
statements that the Sceptic can make, are in regard to his own
sensations. He cannot deny that he is warm or cold or hungry.</p>

<p>Sextus replies to the charge that the Sceptics deny phenomena by
refuting it.<a name="FNanchor_1_81" id="FNanchor_1_81" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_81" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Sceptic does not deny
phenomena, because they are the only criteria by which he can
regulate his actions. "We call the criterion of the Sceptical
School the phenomenon, meaning by this name the idea of it."<a
name="FNanchor_2_82" id="FNanchor_2_82" /><a href="#Footnote_2_82"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Phenomena are the only things which the
Sceptic does not deny, and he guides his life by them. They are,
however, subjective. Sextus distinctly affirms that sensations are
the phenomena,<a name="FNanchor_3_83" id="FNanchor_3_83" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_83" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and that they lie in
susceptibility and voluntary feeling, and that they constitute the
appearances of objects.<a name="FNanchor_4_84" id=
"FNanchor_4_84" /><a href="#Footnote_4_84" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
We see from this that Sextus makes the only reality to consist in
subjective experience, but he does not follow this to its logical
conclusion, and doubt the existence of anything outside of mind. He
rather takes for granted that there is a something unknown outside,
about which the Sceptic can make no assertions. Phenomena are the
criteria according to which the Sceptic orders his daily life, as
he cannot be entirely inactive, and they affect life in four
different ways. They constitute the guidance of nature, the impulse
of feeling; they give rise to the traditions of customs and laws,
and make the teaching of the arts important.<a name="FNanchor_5_85"
id="FNanchor_5_85" /><a href="#Footnote_5_85" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> According to the tradition of laws and customs,
piety is a good in daily life, but it is not in itself an abstract
good. The Sceptic of Sextus' time also inculcated the teaching of
the arts, as indeed must be the case with professing physicians, as
most of the leading Sceptics were. Sextus says, "We are not without
energy in the arts which we undertake."<a name="FNanchor_6_86" id=
"FNanchor_6_86" /><a href="#Footnote_6_86" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
This was a positive tendency which no philosophy, however negative,
could escape, and the Sceptic tried to avoid inconsistency in this
respect, by separating his philosophy from his theory of life. His
philosophy controlled his opinions, and his life was governed by
phenomena.</p>

<p>The aim of Pyrrhonism was ataraxia in those things which pertain
to opinion, and moderation in the things which life imposes.<a
name="FNanchor_1_87" id="FNanchor_1_87" /><a href="#Footnote_1_87"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In other words, we find here the same
natural desire of the human being to rise above and beyond the
limitations which pain and passion impose, which is expressed in
other forms, and under other names, in other schools of philosophy.
The method, however, by which ataraxia or peace of mind could be
reached, was peculiar to the Sceptic. It is a state of
psychological equilibrium, which results from the equality of the
weight of different arguments that are opposed to each other, and
the consequent impossibility of affirming in regard to either one,
that it is correct.<a name="FNanchor_2_88" id="FNanchor_2_88" /><a
href="#Footnote_2_88" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The discovery of
ataraxia was, in the first instance, apparently accidental, for
while the Sceptic withheld his opinion, unable to decide what
things were true, and what things were false, ataraxia fortunately
followed.<a name="FNanchor_3_89" id="FNanchor_3_89" /><a href=

during the time of &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;, or suspension

<p>The Sceptic in seeking ataraxia in the things of opinion, does
not entirely escape from suffering from his sensations. He is not
wholly undisturbed, for he is sometimes cold and hungry, and so
on.<a name="FNanchor_1_92" id="FNanchor_1_92" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_92" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He claims, nevertheless,
that he suffers less than the dogmatist, who is beset with two
kinds of suffering, one from the feelings themselves, and also from
the conviction that they are by nature an evil.<a name=
"FNanchor_2_93" id="FNanchor_2_93" /><a href="#Footnote_2_93"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> To the Sceptic nothing is in itself either
an evil or a good, and so he thinks that "he escapes from
difficulties easier."<a name="FNanchor_3_94" id=
"FNanchor_3_94" /><a href="#Footnote_3_94" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
For instance, he who considers riches a good in themselves, is
unhappy in the loss of them, and in possession of them is in fear
of losing them, while the Sceptic, remembering the Sceptical saying
"No more," is untroubled in whatever condition he may be found, as
the loss of riches is no more an evil than the possession of them
is a good.<a name="FNanchor_4_95" id="FNanchor_4_95" /><a href=
"#Footnote_4_95" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> For he who considers
anything good or bad by nature is always troubled, and when that
which seemed good is not present with him, he thinks that he is
tortured by that which is by nature bad, and follows after what he
thinks to be good. Having acquired it, however, he is not at rest,
for his reason tells him that a sudden change may deprive him of
this thing that he considers a good.<a name="FNanchor_5_96" id=
"FNanchor_5_96" /><a href="#Footnote_5_96" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The Sceptic, however, endeavours neither to avoid nor seek anything
eagerly.<a name="FNanchor_6_97" id="FNanchor_6_97" /><a href=

<p>Ataraxia came to the Sceptic as success in painting the foam on
a horse's mouth came to Apelles the painter. After many attempts to
do this, and many failures, he gave up in despair, and threw the
sponge at the picture that he had used to wipe the colors from the
painting with. As soon as it touched the picture it produced a
representation of the foam.<a name="FNanchor_1_98" id=
"FNanchor_1_98" /><a href="#Footnote_1_98" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Thus the Sceptics were never able to attain to ataraxia by
examining the anomaly between the phenomena and the things of
thought, but it came to them of its own accord just when they
despaired of finding it.</p>

<p>The intellectual preparation for producing ataraxia, consists in
placing arguments in opposition to each other, both in regard to
phenomena, and to things of the intellect. By placing the
phenomenal in opposition to the phenomenal, the intellectual to the
intellectual, and the phenomenal to the intellectual, and <i>vice
versa</i>, the present to the present, past, and future, one will
find that no argument exists that is incontrovertible. It is not
necessary to accept any statement whatever as true, and
consequently a state of &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; may always
be maintained.<a name="FNanchor_2_99" id="FNanchor_2_99" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_99" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Although ataraxia
concerns things of the opinion, and must be preceded by the
intellectual process described above, it is not itself a function
of the intellect, or any subtle kind of reasoning, but seems to be
rather a unique form of moral perfection, leading to happiness, or
is itself happiness.</p>

<p>It was the aim of Scepticism to know nothing, and to assert
nothing in regard to any subject, but at the same time not to
affirm that knowledge on all subjects is impossible, and
consequently to have the attitude of still seeking. The standpoint
of Pyrrhonism was materialistic. We find from the teachings of
Sextus that he affirmed the non-existence of the soul,<a name=

<p>There is no criterion of truth in Scepticism. We cannot prove
that the phenomena represent objects, or find out what the relation
of phenomena to objects is. There is no criterion to tell us which
one is true of all the different representations of the same
object, and of all the varieties of sensation that arise through
the many phases of relativity of the conditions which control the
character of the phenomena.</p>

<p>Every effort to find the truth can deal only with phenomena, and
absolute reality can never be known.</p>

<div class="center"><i>The Sceptical Tropes</i>.</div>

<p>The exposition of the Tropes of Pyrrhonism constitutes
historically and philosophically the most important part of the
writings of Sextus Empiricus. These Tropes represent the sum total
of the wisdom of the older Sceptical School, and were held in high
respect for centuries, not only by the Pyrrhoneans, but also by
many outside the narrow limits of that School. In the first book of
the <i>Hypotyposes</i> Sextus gives two classes of Tropes, those of
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; and the eight Tropes of Aenesidemus
against Aetiology.</p>

<p>The Tropes of &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; are arranged in
groups of ten, five and two, according to the period of the
Sceptical School to which they belong; the first of these groups is
historically the most important, or the Ten Tropes of
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;, as these are far more closely
connected with the general development of Scepticism, than the
later ones. By the name &tau;&rho;&#972;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf; or
Trope, the Sceptic understood a manner of thought, or form of
argument, or standpoint of judgement. It was a term common in Greek
philosophy, used in this sense, from the time of Aristotle.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_103" id="FNanchor_1_103" /><a href="#Footnote_1_103"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Stoics, however, used the word with a
different meaning from that attributed to it by the Sceptics.<a
name="FNanchor_2_104" id="FNanchor_2_104" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_104" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Stephanus and Fabricius
translate it by the Latin word <i>modus</i><a name="FNanchor_3_105"
id="FNanchor_3_105" /><a href="#Footnote_3_105" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> and &tau;&rho;&#972;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf; also
is often used interchangeably with the word
&lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf; by Sextus, Diogenes
Laertius, and others; sometimes also as synonymous with
&tau;&#972;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;, <a name="FNanchor_4_106" id=
"FNanchor_4_106" /><a href="#Footnote_4_106" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> and &tau;&rho;&#972;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf; is
found in the oldest edition of Sextus.<a name="FNanchor_5_107" id=
"FNanchor_5_107" /><a href="#Footnote_5_107" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> Diogenes defines the word as the standpoint, or
manner of argument, by which the Sceptics arrived at the condition
of doubt, in consequence of the equality of probabilities, and he
calls the Tropes, the ten Tropes of doubt.<a name="FNanchor_6_108"
id="FNanchor_6_108" /><a href="#Footnote_6_108" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> All writers on Pyrrhonism after the time of
Aenesidemus give the Tropes the principal place in their treatment
of the subject. Sextus occupies two thirds of the first book of the
<i>Hypotyposes</i> in stating and discussing them; and about one
fourth of his presentation of Scepticism is devoted to the Tropes
by Diogenes. In addition to these two authors, Aristocles the
Peripatetic refers to them in his attack on Scepticism.<a name=
"FNanchor_7_109" id="FNanchor_7_109" /><a href="#Footnote_7_109"

<p>All authorities unite in attributing to Aenesidemus the work of
systematizing and presenting to the world the ten Tropes of
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;. He was the first to conceive the
project of opposing an organized philosophical system of Pyrrhonism
to the dogmatism of his contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_1_111" id=
"FNanchor_1_111" /><a href="#Footnote_1_111" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> Moreover, the fact that Diogenes introduces the
Tropes into his life of Pyrrho, does not necessarily imply that he
considered Pyrrho their author, for Diogenes invariably combines
the teachings of the followers of a movement with those of the
founders themselves; he gives these Tropes after speaking of
Aenesidemus' work entitled <i>Pyrrhonean Hypotyposes</i>, and
apparently quotes from this book, in giving at least a part of his
presentation of Pyrrhonism, either directly or through, the works
of others. Nietzsche proposes a correction of the text of Diogenes
IX. 11, 79, which would make him quote the Tropes from a book by
Theodosius,<a name="FNanchor_2_112" id="FNanchor_2_112" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_112" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> author of a commentary
on the works of Theodas. No writer of antiquity claims for the
Tropes an older source than the books of Aenesidemus, to whom
Aristocles also attributes them.<a name="FNanchor_3_113" id=
"FNanchor_3_113" /><a href="#Footnote_3_113" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> They are not mentioned in Diogenes' life of
Timon, the immediate disciple of Pyrrho. Cicero has no knowledge of
them, and does not refer to them in his discussion of
Scepticism.</p>

<p>Aenesidemus was undoubtedly the first to formulate these Tropes,
but many things tend to show that they resulted, in reality, from
the gradual classification of the results of the teachings of
Pyrrho, in the subsequent development of thought from his own time
to that of Aenesidemus. The ideas contained in the Tropes were not
original with Aenesidemus, but are more closely connected with the
thought of earlier times. The decidedly empirical character of the
Tropes proves this connection, for the eight Tropes of Aetiology,
which were original with Aenesidemus, bear a far stronger dialectic
stamp, thus showing a more decided dialectic influence of the
Academy than is found in the Tropes of
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;. Many of the illustrations given of
the Tropes also, testify to a time of greater antiquity than that
of Aenesidemus. The name Trope was well known in ancient times, and
the number ten reminds us of the ten opposing principles of
Pythagoras, and the ten categories of Aristotle, the fourth of
which was the same as the eighth Trope. The terminology, however,
with very few exceptions, points to a later period than that of
Pyrrho. Zeller points out a number of expressions in both Diogenes'
and Sextus' exposition of the Tropes, which could not date back
farther than the time of Aenesidemus.<a name="FNanchor_1_114" id=
"FNanchor_1_114" /><a href="#Footnote_1_114" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> One of the most striking features of the whole
presentation of the Tropes, especially as given by Sextus, is their
mosaic character, stamping them not as the work of one person, but
as a growth, and also an agglutinous growth, lacking very decidedly
the symmetry of thought that the work of one mind would have
shown.</p>

</div>

<p>At the time of the separation of Pyrrhonism from the Academy, no
other force was as strong in giving life to the school as the
systematic treatment by Aenesidemus of the Ten Tropes of
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;. The reason of this is evident. It
was not that the ideas of the Sceptical Tropes were original with
Aenesidemus, but because a definite statement of belief is always a
far more powerful influence than principles which are vaguely
understood and accepted. There is always, however, the danger to
the Sceptic, in making a statement even of the principles of
Scepticism, that the psychological result would be a dogmatic
tendency of mind, as we shall see later was the case, even with
Aenesidemus himself. That the Sceptical School could not escape the
accusation of dogmatizing, from the Dogmatics, even in stating the
grounds of their Scepticism, we know from Diogenes.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_115" id="FNanchor_1_115" /><a href="#Footnote_1_115"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> To avoid this dogmatic tendency of the ten
Tropes, Sextus makes the frequent assertion that he does not affirm
things to be absolutely true, but states them as they appear to
him, and that they may be otherwise from what he has said.<a name=

<p>Sextus tells us that "Certain Tropes, ten in number, for
producing the state of &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; have been
handed down from the older Sceptics."<a name="FNanchor_1_117" id=
"FNanchor_1_117" /><a href="#Footnote_1_117" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> He refers to them in another work as the "Tropes
of Aenesidemus."<a name="FNanchor_2_118" id="FNanchor_2_118" /><a
href="#Footnote_2_118" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There is no
evidence that the substance of these Tropes was changed after the
time of Aenesidemus, although many of the illustrations given by
Sextus must have been of a later date, added during the two
centuries that elapsed between the time of Aenesidemus and Sextus.
In giving these Tropes Sextus does not claim to offer a systematic
methodical classification, and closes his list of them, in their
original concise form, with the remark, "We make this order
ourselves."<a name="FNanchor_3_119" id="FNanchor_3_119" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_119" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The order is given
differently by Diogenes, and also by Favorinus.<a name=
"FNanchor_4_120" id="FNanchor_4_120" /><a href="#Footnote_4_120"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The Trope which Sextus gives as the tenth
is the fifth given by Diogenes, the seventh by Sextus is the eighth
given by Diogenes, the fifth by Sextus, the seventh by Diogenes,
the tenth by Diogenes, the eighth by Sextus. Diogenes says that the
one he gives as the ninth Favorinus calls the eighth, and Sextus
and Aenesidemus the tenth. This statement does not correspond with
the list of the Tropes which Sextus gives, proving that Diogenes
took some other text than that of Sextus as his authority.<a name=
"FNanchor_5_121" id="FNanchor_5_121" /><a href="#Footnote_5_121"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The difference in the order of the Tropes
shows, also, that the order was not considered a matter of great
importance. There is a marked contrast in the spirit of the two
presentations of the Tropes given by Sextus and Diogenes. The
former gives them not only as an orator, but as one who feels that
he is defending his own cause, and the school of which he is the
leader, against mortal enemies, while Diogenes relates them as an
historian.</p>

<p>Pappenheim tries to prove<a name="FNanchor_1_122" id=
"FNanchor_1_122" /><a href="#Footnote_1_122" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> that Aenesidemus originally gave only nine
Tropes in his <i>Pyrrhonean Hypotyposes</i>, as Aristocles mentions
only nine in referring to the Tropes of Aenesidemus, and that the
tenth was added later. Had this been the case, however, the fact
would surely have been mentioned either by Diogenes or Sextus, who
both refer to the ten Tropes of Aenesidemus.</p>

<p>The Tropes claim to prove that the character of phenomena is so
relative and changeable, that certain knowledge cannot be based
upon them, and as we have shown, there is no other criterion of
knowledge for the Sceptic than phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_2_123"
id="FNanchor_2_123" /><a href="#Footnote_2_123" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> All of the Tropes, except the tenth, are
connected with sense-perception, and relate to the difference of
the results obtained through the senses under different
circumstances. They may be divided into two classes, <i>i.e.</i>,
those based upon differences of our physical organism, and those
based upon external differences. To the first class belong the
first, second, third and fourth; to the second class, the fifth,
sixth, seventh and eighth, and also the ninth. The eighth, or that
of relation, is applied objectively both by Sextus and Diogenes in
their treatment of the Tropes, and is not used for objects of
thought alone, but principally to show the relation of outward
objects to each other. The tenth is the only one which has a moral
significance, and it has also a higher subjective value than the
others; it takes its arguments from an entirely different sphere of
thought, and deals with metaphysical and religious contradictions
in opinion, and with the question of good and evil. That this Trope
is one of the oldest, we know from its distinct mention in
connection with the foundation theories of Pyrrho, by Diogenes.<a
name="FNanchor_3_124" id="FNanchor_3_124" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_124" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In treating of the
subjective reasons for doubt as to the character of external
reality, the Sceptics were very near the denial of all outward
reality, a point, however, which they never quite reached.</p>

<p>There is evidently much of Sextus' own thought mixed with the
illustrations of the Tropes, but it is impossible to separate the
original parts from the material that was the common property of
the Sceptical School. Many of these illustrations show, however,
perfect familiarity with the scientific and medical teachings of
the time. Before entering upon his exposition of the Tropes, Sextus
gives them in the short concise form in which they must first have
existed<a name="FNanchor_1_125" id="FNanchor_1_125" /><a href=

<p>Although Sextus is careful not to dogmatise regarding the
arrangement of the Tropes, yet there is in his classification of
them a regular gradation, from the arguments based upon differences
in animals to those in man, first considering the latter in
relation to the physical constitution, and then to circumstances
outside of us, and finally the treatment of metaphysical and moral
differences.</p>

<p><i>The First Trope</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_126" id=
"FNanchor_1_126" /><a href="#Footnote_1_126" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> That the same mental representations are not
found in different animals, may be inferred from their differences
in constitution resulting from their different origins, and from
the variety in their organs of sense. Sextus takes up the five
senses in order, giving illustrations to prove the relative results
of the mental representations in all of them, as for example the
subjectivity of color<a name="FNanchor_2_127" id=
"FNanchor_2_127" /><a href="#Footnote_2_127" class=

"fnanchor">[3]</a> All knowledge of objects through the senses is
relative and not absolute. Sextus does not, accordingly, confine
the impossibility of certain knowledge to the qualities that Locke
regards as secondary, but includes also the primary ones in this
statement.<a name="FNanchor_4_129" id="FNanchor_4_129" /><a href=

way as the eyes of animals are of different shapes, and supplied
with different fluids, the ideas of dogs, fishes, men and

<p>In discussing the mental representations of animals of different
grades of intelligence, Sextus shows a very good comprehension of
the philogenetic development of the organs of sense, and draws the
final conclusion that external objects are regarded differently by
animals, according to their difference in constitution.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_131" id="FNanchor_1_131" /><a href="#Footnote_1_131"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> These differences in the ideas which
different animals have of the same objects are demonstrated by
their different tastes, as the things desired by some are fatal to
others.<a name="FNanchor_2_132" id="FNanchor_2_132" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_132" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The practical
illustrations given of this result show a familiarity with natural
history, and cognizance of the tastes and habits of many animals,<a
name="FNanchor_3_133" id="FNanchor_3_133" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_133" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but were probably few of
them original with Sextus, unless perhaps in their application;
that this train of reasoning was the common property of the Sceptic
School, we know from the fact that Diogenes begins his exposition
of the first Trope in a way similar to that of Sextus.<a name=
"FNanchor_4_134" id="FNanchor_4_134" /><a href="#Footnote_4_134"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> His illustrations are, however, few and
meagre compared with those of Sextus, and the scientific facts used
by both of them may mostly be found in other authors of antiquity
given in a similar way.<a name="FNanchor_5_135" id=
"FNanchor_5_135" /><a href="#Footnote_5_135" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> The logical result of the reasoning used to
explain the first Trope, is that we cannot compare the ideas of the
animals with each other, nor with our own; nor can we prove that
our ideas are more trustworthy than those of the animals.<a name=
"FNanchor_6_136" id="FNanchor_6_136" /><a href="#Footnote_6_136"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> As therefore an examination of ideas is
impossible, any decided opinion about their trustworthiness is also
impossible, and this Trope leads to the suspension of judgment
regarding external objects, or to
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;.<a name="FNanchor_7_137" id=

<p>After reaching this conclusion, Sextus introduces a long chapter
to prove that animals can reason. There is no reference to this in
Diogenes, but there is other testimony to show that it was a
favourite line of argument with the Sceptics.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_138" id="FNanchor_1_138" /><a href="#Footnote_1_138"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Sextus, however, says that his course of
reasoning is different from that of most of the Sceptics on the
subject,<a name="FNanchor_2_139" id="FNanchor_2_139" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_139" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as they usually applied
their arguments to all animals, while he selected only one, namely
the dog.<a name="FNanchor_3_140" id="FNanchor_3_140" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_140" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This chapter is full of
sarcastic attacks on the Dogmatics, and contains the special
allusion to the Stoics as the greatest opponents of the Sceptics,
which has been before referred to.<a name="FNanchor_4_141" id=
"FNanchor_4_141" /><a href="#Footnote_4_141" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Sextus claims with a greater freedom of diction than in some
apparently less original chapters, and with a wealth of special
illustrations, that the dog is superior to man in acuteness of
perception,<a name="FNanchor_5_142" id="FNanchor_5_142" /><a href=
"#Footnote_5_142" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that he has the power of
choice, and possesses an art, that of hunting,<a name=
"FNanchor_6_143" id="FNanchor_6_143" /><a href="#Footnote_6_143"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and, also, is not deprived of virtue,<a
name="FNanchor_7_144" id="FNanchor_7_144" /><a href=
"#Footnote_7_144" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> as the true nature of
virtue is to show justice to all, which the dog does by guarding
loyally those who are kind to him, and keeping off those who do
evil.<a name="FNanchor_8_145" id="FNanchor_8_145" /><a href=
"#Footnote_8_145" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The reasoning power of
this animal is proved by the story taken from Chrysippus, of the
dog that came to a meeting of three roads in following a scent.
After seeking the scent in vain in two of the roads, he takes the
third road without scenting it as a result of a quick process of
thought, which proves that he shares in the famous dialectic of
Chrysippus,<a name="FNanchor_9_146" id="FNanchor_9_146" /><a href=
"#Footnote_9_146" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the five forms of
&#7936;&nu;&alpha;&pi;&#972;&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota;
&lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&iota;, of which the dog chooses the
fifth. Either <i>A</i> or <i>B</i> or <i>C</i>, not <i>A</i> or
<i>B,</i> therefore <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>The dog and other irrational animals may also possess spoken
language, as the only proof that we have to the contrary, is the
fact that we cannot understand the sounds that they make.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_147" id="FNanchor_1_147" /><a href="#Footnote_1_147"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We have an example in this chapter of the
humor of Sextus, who after enlarging on the perfect character of

philosophers have honoured themselves with the name of this
animal,"<a name="FNanchor_2_148" id="FNanchor_2_148" /><a href=

<p><i>The Second Trope</i>. Passing on to the second Trope, Sextus
aims to prove that even if we leave the differences of the mental
images of animals out of the discussion, there is not a sufficient
unanimity in the mental images of human beings to allow us to base
any assertions upon them in regard to the character of external
objects.<a name="FNanchor_1_150" id="FNanchor_1_150" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_150" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He had previously
announced that he intended to oppose the phenomenal to the
intellectual "in any way whatever,"<a name="FNanchor_2_151" id=
"FNanchor_2_151" /><a href="#Footnote_2_151" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> so he begins here by referring to the two parts
of which man is said to be composed, the soul and the body, and
proceeds to discuss the differences among men in sense-perception
and in opinion.<a name="FNanchor_3_152" id="FNanchor_3_152" /><a
href="#Footnote_3_152" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Most of the
illustrations given of differences in sense-perception are medical
ones; of the more general of these I will note the only two which
are also given by Diogenes in his exposition of this Trope,<a name=
"FNanchor_4_153" id="FNanchor_4_153" /><a href="#Footnote_4_153"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> viz., Demophon, Alexander's table waiter,
who shivered in the sun, and Andron the Argive, who was so free
from thirst that he travelled through the desert of Libya without
seeking a drink. Some have reasoned from the presence of the first
of these illustrations in the exposition of the Tropes, that a part
of this material at least goes back to the time of Pyrrho, as
Pyrrho from his intimacy with Alexander, when he accompanied him to
India, had abundant opportunities to observe the peculiarities of
his servant Demophon.<a name="FNanchor_5_154" id=
"FNanchor_5_154" /><a href="#Footnote_5_154" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> The illustration of Andron the Argive is taken
from Aristotle, according to Diogenes.<a name="FNanchor_6_155" id=

<p>Passing on to differences of opinion, we have another example of
the sarcastic humor of Sextus, as he refers to the
&phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&gamma;&nu;&omega;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&kappa;&#942;
&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&#943;&alpha;<a name="FNanchor_1_156" id=
"FNanchor_1_156" /><a href="#Footnote_1_156" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> as the authority for believing that the body is
a type of the soul. As the bodies of men differ, so the souls also
probably differ. The differences of mind among men is not referred
to by Diogenes, except in the general statement that they choose
different professions; while Sextus elaborates this point, speaking
of the great differences in opposing schools of philosophy, and in
the objects of choice and avoidance, and sources of pleasure for
different men.<a name="FNanchor_2_157" id="FNanchor_2_157" /><a

<p><i>The Third Trope</i>. The third Trope limits the argument to
the sense-perceptions of one man, a Dogmatic, if preferred, or to
one whom the Dogmatics consider wise,<a name="FNanchor_1_159" id=
"FNanchor_1_159" /><a href="#Footnote_1_159" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> and states that as the ideas given by the
different sense organs differ radically in a way that does not
admit of their being compared with each other, they furnish no
reliable testimony regarding the nature of objects.<a name=
"FNanchor_2_160" id="FNanchor_2_160" /><a href="#Footnote_2_160"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "Each of the phenomena perceived by us
seems to present itself in many forms, as the apple, smooth,
fragrant brown and sweet." The apple was evidently the ordinary
example given for this Trope, for Diogenes uses the same, but in a
much more condensed form, and not with equal understanding of the
results to be deduced from it.<a name="FNanchor_3_161" id=
"FNanchor_3_161" /><a href="#Footnote_3_161" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> The consequence of the incompatibility of the
mental representations produced through the several sense organs by
the apple, may be the acceptance of either of the three following
propositions: (i) That only those qualities exist in the apple
which we perceive. (ii) That more than these exist. (iii) That even
those perceived do not exist.<a name="FNanchor_4_162" id=
"FNanchor_4_162" /><a href="#Footnote_4_162" class=

to such different views regarding outward objects, cannot be relied
upon as a testimony concerning them.</p>

<p>The non-homogeneous nature of the mental images connected with
the different sense organs, as presented by Sextus, reminds us of
the discussion of the same subject by Berkeley in his <i>Theory of
Vision</i>.</p>

<p>Sextus says that a man born with less than the usual number of
senses, would form altogether different ideas of the external world
than those who have the usual number, and as our ideas of objects
depend on our mental images, a greater number of sense organs would
give us still different ideas of outward reality.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_163" id="FNanchor_1_163" /><a href="#Footnote_1_163"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The strong argument of the Stoics against
such reasoning as this, was their doctrine of pre-established
harmony between nature and the soul, so that when a representation
is produced in us of a real object, a
&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&lambda;&eta;&pi;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8052;
&phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&#943;&alpha;,<a name=
"FNanchor_2_164" id="FNanchor_2_164" /><a href="#Footnote_2_164"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> by this representation the soul grasps a
real existence. There is a &lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;
in us which is of the same kind,
&sigma;&#973;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;, or in
relation to all nature. This argument of pre-established harmony
between the faculties of the soul and the objects of nature, is the
one that has been used in all ages to combat philosophical teaching
that denies that we apprehend the external world as it is. It was
used against Kant by his opponents, who thought in this way to
refute his teachings.<a name="FNanchor_3_165" id=
"FNanchor_3_165" /><a href="#Footnote_3_165" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> The Sceptics could not, of course, accept a
theory of nature that included the soul and the external world in
one harmonious whole, but Sextus in his discussion of the third
Trope does not refute this argument as fully as he does later in
his work against logic.<a name="FNanchor_4_166" id=
"FNanchor_4_166" /><a href="#Footnote_4_166" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> He simply states here that philosophers
themselves cannot agree as to what nature is, and furthermore, that
a philosopher himself is a part of the discord, and to be judged,
rather than being capable of judging, and that no conclusion can be
reached by those who are themselves an element of the
uncertainty.<a name="FNanchor_5_167" id="FNanchor_5_167" /><a href=

<p><i>The Fourth Trope</i>. This Trope limits the argument to each
separate sense, and the effect is considered of the condition of
body and mind upon sense-perception in relation to the several
sense-organs.<a name="FNanchor_1_168" id="FNanchor_1_168" /><a
href="#Footnote_1_168" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The physical states
which modify sense-perception are health and illness, sleeping and
waking, youth and age, hunger and satiety, drunkenness and
sobriety. All of these conditions of the body entirely change the
character of the mental images, producing different judgments of
the color, taste, and temperature of objects, and of the character
of sounds. A man who is asleep is in a different world from one
awake, the existence of both worlds being relative to the condition
of waking and sleeping.<a name="FNanchor_2_169" id=
"FNanchor_2_169" /><a href="#Footnote_2_169" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The subjective states which Sextus mentions here as modifying

courage or fear, sorrow or joy, and sanity or insanity.<a name=

<p>Diogenes gives in part the same illustrations of this Trope, but
in a much more condensed form. The marked characteristic of this
train of reasoning is the attempt to prove that abnormal conditions
are also natural. In referring at first to the opposing states of
body and mind, which so change the character of sense-perception,
Sextus classifies them according to the popular usage as
&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8048; &phi;&#973;&sigma;&iota;&nu; and
&pi;&alpha;&rho;&#8048; &phi;&#973;&sigma;&iota;&nu;. This
distinction was an important one, even with Aristotle, and was
especially developed by the Stoics<a name="FNanchor_1_173" id=
"FNanchor_1_173" /><a href="#Footnote_1_173" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> in a broader sense than referring merely to
health and sickness. The Stoics, however, considered only normal
conditions as being according to nature. Sextus, on the contrary,
declares that abnormal states are also conditions according to
nature,<a name="FNanchor_2_174" id="FNanchor_2_174" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_174" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and just as those who
are in health are in a state that is natural to those who are in
health, so also those not in health are in a state that is natural
to those not in health, and in some respects according to nature.
Existence, then, and non-existence are not absolute, but relative,
and the world of sleep as really exists for those who are asleep as
the things that exist in waking exist, although they do not exist
in sleep.<a name="FNanchor_3_175" id="FNanchor_3_175" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_175" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> One mental
representation, therefore, cannot be judged by another, which is
also in a state of relation to existing physical and mental
conditions. Diogenes states this principle even more decidedly in
his exposition of this Trope. "The insane are not in a condition
opposed to nature; why they more than we? For we also see the sun
as if it were stationary."<a name="FNanchor_4_176" id=
"FNanchor_4_176" /><a href="#Footnote_4_176" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> Furthermore, in different periods of life ideas
differ. Children are fond of balls and hoops, while those in their
prime prefer other things, and the aged still others.<a name=
"FNanchor_5_177" id="FNanchor_5_177" /><a href="#Footnote_5_177"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The wisdom contained in this Trope in
reference to the relative value of the things most sought after is
not original with Sextus, but is found in the more earnest ethical
teachings of older writers. Sextus does not, however, draw any
moral conclusions from this reasoning, but only uses it as an
argument for &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;.</p>

<p><i>The Fifth Trope</i>. This Trope leaves the discussion of the
dependence of the ideas upon the physical nature, and takes up the
influence of the environment upon them. It makes the difference in
ideas depend upon the position, distance, and place of objects,
thus taking apparently their real existence for granted. Things
change their form and shape according to the distance from which
they are observed, and the position in which they stand.<a name=

"#Footnote_4_181" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of the neck of the dove
differing in color in different degrees of inclination, an

<p><i>The Sixth Trope</i>. This Trope leads to
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; regarding the nature of objects,
because no object can ever be presented to the organs of sense
directly, but must always be perceived through some medium, or in
some mixture.<a name="FNanchor_1_184" id="FNanchor_1_184" /><a
href="#Footnote_1_184" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This mixture may be
an outward one, connected with the temperature, or the rarity of
the air, or the water<a name="FNanchor_2_185" id=
"FNanchor_2_185" /><a href="#Footnote_2_185" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> surrounding an object, or it may be a mixture
resulting from the different humors of the sense-organs.<a name=
"FNanchor_3_186" id="FNanchor_3_186" /><a href="#Footnote_3_186"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> A man with the jaundice, for example, sees
colors differently from one who is in health. The illustration of
the jaundice is a favorite one with the Sceptics. Diogenes uses it
several times in his presentation of Scepticism, and it occurs in
Sextus' writings in all, as an illustration, in eight different
places.<a name="FNanchor_4_187" id="FNanchor_4_187" /><a href=
"#Footnote_4_187" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The condition of the
organ of the
&#7969;&gamma;&epsilon;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#972;&nu;, or
the ruling faculty, may also cause mixtures. Pappenheim thinks that
we have here Kant's idea of <i>a priori</i>, only on a
materialistic foundation.<a name="FNanchor_5_188" id=
"FNanchor_5_188" /><a href="#Footnote_5_188" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> A careful consideration of the passage, however,
shows us that Sextus' thought is more in harmony with the
discoveries of modern psychiatry than with the philosophy of Kant.
If the sentence, &#7988;&sigma;&omega;&sigmaf; &delta;&#8050;

"#Footnote_6_189" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> stood alone, without
further explanation, it might well refer to <i>a priori</i> laws of
thought, but the explanation which follows beginning with "because"
makes that impossible.<a name="FNanchor_7_190" id=
"FNanchor_7_190" /><a href="#Footnote_7_190" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> "Because in each of the places where the
Dogmatics think that the ruling faculty is, we see present certain
humors, which are the cause of mixtures." Sextus does not advance
any opinion as to the place of the ruling faculty in the body,
which is, according to the Stoics, the principal part of the soul,
where ideas, desires, and reasoning originate,<a name=
"FNanchor_8_191" id="FNanchor_8_191" /><a href="#Footnote_8_191"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> but simply refers to the two theories of
the Dogmatics, which claim on the one hand that it is in the brain,
and on the other that it is in the heart.<a name="FNanchor_9_192"

discussing possible intellectual mixtures in illustration of the
sixth Trope, entirely on the condition of the organ of the
intellect, it is evident that his theory of the soul was a
materialistic one.</p>

<p><i>The Seventh Trope</i>. This Trope, based upon the quantities
and compositions of objects, is illustrated by examples of
different kinds of food, drink, and medicine, showing the different
effects according to the quantity taken, as the harmfulness and the
usefulness of most things depend on their quantity. Things act
differently upon the senses if applied in small or large
quantities, as filings of metal or horn, and separate grains of
sand have a different color and touch from the same taken in the
form of a solid.<a name="FNanchor_1_194" id="FNanchor_1_194" /><a
href="#Footnote_1_194" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The result is that
ideas vary according to the composition of the object, and this

and leads us to reserve our opinion in regard to them.<a name=

<p><i>The Eighth Trope</i>. The Trope based upon relation contains,
as Sextus rightly remarks, the substance of the other nine,<a name=
"FNanchor_1_197" id="FNanchor_1_197" /><a href="#Footnote_1_197"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for the general statement of the
relativity of knowledge includes the other statements made. The
prominence which Sextus gave this Trope in his introduction to the
ten Tropes leads one to expect here new illustrations and added<a
name="FNanchor_2_198" id="FNanchor_2_198" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_198" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> arguments for
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;. We find, however, neither of
these, but simply a statement that all things are in relation in
one of two ways, either directly, or as being a part of a
difference. These two kinds of relation are given by Protagoras,
and might have been used to good purpose in the introduction to the
Tropes, or at the end, to prove that all the others were really
subordinate to the eighth. The reasoning is, however simply applied
to the relation of objects to each other, and nothing is added that
is not found elsewhere where as an argument for
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;.<a name="FNanchor_3_199" id=
"FNanchor_3_199" /><a href="#Footnote_3_199" class=

<p><i>The Ninth Trope</i>. This is based upon the frequency and
rarity of events, and refers to some of the phenomena of nature,
such as the rising of the sun, and the sea, as no longer a source
of astonishment, while a comet or an earthquake are wonders to
those not accustomed to them.<a name="FNanchor_1_201" id=
"FNanchor_1_201" /><a href="#Footnote_1_201" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> The value of objects also depends on their
rarity, as for example the value of gold.<a name="FNanchor_2_202"
id="FNanchor_2_202" /><a href="#Footnote_2_202" class=

<p><i>The Tenth Trope</i>. We have already remarked on the
difference in the character of the tenth Trope, dealing as it does,
not with the ideas of objects, like the other nine Tropes, but with
philosophical and religious opinions, and questions of right and
wrong. It was the well-known aim of the Sceptics to submit to the
laws and customs of the land where they were found, and to conform
to certain moral teachings and religious ceremonies; this they did
without either affirming or denying the truth of the principles
upon which these teachings were based,<a name="FNanchor_1_205" id=
"FNanchor_1_205" /><a href="#Footnote_1_205" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> and also without any passion or strong feeling
in regard to them,<a name="FNanchor_2_206" id="FNanchor_2_206" /><a
href="#Footnote_2_206" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as nothing in
itself can be proved to be good or evil. The tenth Trope
accordingly, brings forward contradictions in customs, laws, and
the beliefs of different lands, to show that they are also
changeable and relative, and not of absolute worth. The
foundation-thought of this Trope is given twice by Diogenes, once
as we have before stated in his introduction<a name=
"FNanchor_3_207" id="FNanchor_3_207" /><a href="#Footnote_3_207"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to the life of Pyrrho, and also as one of
the Tropes.<a name="FNanchor_4_208" id="FNanchor_4_208" /><a href=
"#Footnote_4_208" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> As it is apparently one
of the oldest of the Tropes, it would naturally be much used in
discussing with the Stoics, whose philosophy had such a wide
ethical significance, and must also have held an important place in
the Sceptical School in all metaphysical and philosophical
discussions. The definition<a name="FNanchor_5_209" id=
"FNanchor_5_209" /><a href="#Footnote_5_209" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> in the beginning of Sextus' exposition of this
Trope Fabricius thinks was taken from Aristotle, of schools, laws,
customs, mythical beliefs and dogmatic opinions,<a name=

class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the definition which Diogenes gives of
law in his life of Plato<a name="FNanchor_7_211" id=
"FNanchor_7_211" /><a href="#Footnote_7_211" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> is similar. Pappenheim, however, thinks they
were taken from the Stoics, perhaps from Chrysippus.<a name=
"FNanchor_8_212" id="FNanchor_8_212" /><a href="#Footnote_8_212"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The argument is based upon the differences
in development of thought, as affecting the standpoint of judgment
in philosophy, in morals, and religion, the results of which we
find in the widely opposing schools of philosophy, in the variety
in religious belief, and in the laws and customs of different
countries. Therefore the decisions reached in the world of thought
leave us equally in doubt regarding the absolute value of any
standards, with those obtained through sense-perception, and the
universal conflict of opinion regarding all questions of philosophy
and ethics leads us also according to this Trope to the reserving
of the opinion.<a name="FNanchor_9_213" id="FNanchor_9_213" /><a
href="#Footnote_9_213" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This Trope is the
fifth as given by Diogenes, who placed it directly after the first
four which relate more especially to human development,<a name=
"FNanchor_10_214" id="FNanchor_10_214" /><a href="#Footnote_10_214"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> while Sextus uses it as the final one,
perhaps thinking that an argument based upon the higher powers of
man deserves the last place, or is the summation of the other
arguments.</p>

<p>Following the exposition of the ten Tropes of the older
Sceptics, Sextus gives the five Tropes which he attributes to the
"later Sceptics."<a name="FNanchor_1_215" id="FNanchor_1_215" /><a
href="#Footnote_1_215" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Sextus nowhere
mentions the author of these Tropes. Diogenes, however, attributes
them to Agrippa, a man of whom we know nothing except his mention
of him. He was evidently one of the followers of Aenesidemus, and a
scholar of influence in the Sceptical School, who must have himself
had disciples, as Diogenes says, &omicron;&#7985;
&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054;
&#7944;&gamma;&rho;&#943;&pi;&pi;&alpha;&nu; <a name=
"FNanchor_2_216" id="FNanchor_2_216" /><a href="#Footnote_2_216"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> add to these tropes other five tropes,
using the plural verb. Another Sceptic, also mentioned by Diogenes,
and a man unknown from other sources, named some of his books after
Agrippa.<a name="FNanchor_3_217" id="FNanchor_3_217" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_217" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Agrippa is not given by
Diogenes in the list of the leaders of the Sceptical School, but<a
name="FNanchor_4_218" id="FNanchor_4_218" /><a href=
"#Footnote_4_218" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> his influence in the
development of the thought of the School must have been great, as
the transition from the ten Tropes of the "older Sceptics" to the
five attributed to Agrippa is a marked one, and shows the entrance
into the school of a logical power before unknown in it. The latter
are not a reduction of the Tropes of Aenesidemus, but are written
from an entirely different standpoint. The ten Tropes are
empirical, and aim to furnish objective proofs of the foundation
theories of Pyrrhonism, while the five are rather rules of thought
leading to logical proof, and are dialectic in their character. We
find this distinction illustrated by the different way in which the
Trope of relativity is treated in the two groups. In the first it
points to an objective relativity, but with Agrippa to a general
subjective logical principle. The originality of the Tropes of
Agrippa does not lie in their substance matter, but in their
formulation and use in the Sceptical School. These methods of proof
were, of course, not new, but were well known to Aristotle, and
were used by the Sceptical Academy, and probably also by Timon,<a
name="FNanchor_5_219" id="FNanchor_5_219" /><a href=
"#Footnote_5_219" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> while the
&pi;&rho;&#972;&sigmaf; &tau;&iota; goes back at least to
Protagoras. The five Tropes are as follows.</p>

<p>Two of these are taken from the old list, the first and the
third, and Sextus says that the five Tropes are intended to
supplement the ten Tropes, and to show the audacity of the
Dogmatics in a variety of ways.<a name="FNanchor_6_220" id=
"FNanchor_6_220" /><a href="#Footnote_6_220" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> The order of these Tropes is the same with
Diogenes as with Sextus, but the definitions of them differ
sufficiently to show that the two authors took their material from
different sources. According to the first one everything in
question is either sensible or intellectual, and in attempting to
judge it either in life, practically, or "among philosophers," a
position is developed from which it is impossible to reach a
conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_7_221" id="FNanchor_7_221" /><a href=
"#Footnote_7_221" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> According to the second,
every proof requires another proof, and so on to infinity, and
there is no standpoint from which to begin the reasoning.<a name=
"FNanchor_8_222" id="FNanchor_8_222" /><a href="#Footnote_8_222"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> According to the third, all perceptions
are relative, as the object is colored by the condition of the
judge, and the influence of other things around it.<a name=
"FNanchor_9_223" id="FNanchor_9_223" /><a href="#Footnote_9_223"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a> According to the fourth, it is impossible
to escape from the <i>regressus in infinitum</i> by making a
hypothesis the starting point, as the Dogmatics attempt to do.<a
name="FNanchor_10_224" id="FNanchor_10_224" /><a href=
"#Footnote_10_224" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And the fifth, or the
<i>circulus in probando</i>, arises when that which should be the
proof needs to be sustained by the thing to be proved.</p>

<p>Sextus claims that all things can be included in these Tropes,
whether sensible or intellectual.<a name="FNanchor_1_225" id=
"FNanchor_1_225" /><a href="#Footnote_1_225" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> For whether, as some say, only the things of
sense are true, or as others claim, only those of the
understanding, or as still others contend, some things both of
sense and understanding are true, a discord must arise that is
impossible to be judged, for it cannot be judged by the sensible,
nor by the intellectual, for the things of the intellect themselves
require a proof; accordingly, the result of all reasoning must be
either hypothetical, or fall into the <i>regressus in infinitum</i>
or the <i>circulus in probando</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_226" id=
"FNanchor_2_226" /><a href="#Footnote_2_226" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> The reference above to some who say that only
the things of sense are true, is to Epicurus and Protagoras; to
some that only the things of thought are true, to Democritus and
Plato; and to those that claimed some of both to be true, to the
Stoics and the Peripatetics.<a name="FNanchor_3_227" id=
"FNanchor_3_227" /><a href="#Footnote_3_227" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> The three new Tropes added by Agrippa have
nothing to do with sense-perception, but bear entirely upon the
possibility of reasoning, as demanded by the science of logic, in
contrast to the earlier ones which related almost entirely, with
the exception of the tenth, to material objects. Sextus claims that
these five Tropes also lead to the suspension of judgment,<a name=
"FNanchor_4_228" id="FNanchor_4_228" /><a href="#Footnote_4_228"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but their logical result is rather the
dogmatic denial of all possibility of knowledge, showing as Hirzel
has well demonstrated, far more the influence of the New Academy
than the spirit of the Sceptical School.<a name="FNanchor_5_229"
id="FNanchor_5_229" /><a href="#Footnote_5_229" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> It was the standpoint of the older Sceptics,
that although the search for the truth had not yet succeeded, yet
they were still seekers, and Sextus claims to be faithful to this
old aim of the Pyrrhonists. He calls himself a seeker,<a name=
"FNanchor_6_230" id="FNanchor_6_230" /><a href="#Footnote_6_230"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and in reproaching the New Academy for
affirming that knowledge is impossible, Sextus says, "Moreover, we
say that our ideas are equal as regards trustworthiness and
untrustworthiness."<a name="FNanchor_7_231" id=
"FNanchor_7_231" /><a href="#Footnote_7_231" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> The ten Tropes claim to establish doubt only in
regard to a knowledge of the truth, but the five Tropes of Agrippa
aim to logically prove the impossibility of knowledge. It is very
strange that Sextus does not see this decided contrast in the
attitude of the two sets of Tropes, and expresses his approval of
those of Agrippa, and makes more frequent use of the fifth of
these, &#972;
&delta;&iota;&#8049;&lambda;&lambda;&eta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
in his subsequent reasoning than of any other argument.<a name=

<p>We find here in the Sceptical School, shortly after the time of
Aenesidemus, the same tendency to dogmatic teaching that&mdash;so
far as the dim and shadowy history of the last years of the New
Academy can be unravelled, and the separation of Pyrrhonism can be
understood, at the time that the Academy passed over into
eclecticism&mdash;was one of the causes of that separation.</p>

<p>It is true that the Tropes of Agrippa show great progress in the
development of thought. They furnish an organisation of the School
far superior to what went before, placing the reasoning on the firm
basis of the laws of logic, and simplifying the amount of material
to be used. In a certain sense Saisset is correct in saying that
Agrippa contributed more than any other in completing the
organisation of Scepticism,<a name="FNanchor_1_233" id=
"FNanchor_1_233" /><a href="#Footnote_1_233" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> but it is not correct when we consider the true
spirit of Scepticism with which the Tropes of Agrippa were not in
harmony. It was through the very progress shown in the production
of these Tropes that the school finally lost the strength of its
position.</p>

<p>Not content with having reduced the number of the Tropes from
ten to five, others tried to limit the number still further to
two.<a name="FNanchor_2_234" id="FNanchor_2_234" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_234" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Sextus gives us no hint
of the authorship of the two Tropes. Ritter attributes them to
Menodotus and his followers, and Zeller agrees with that opinion,<a
name="FNanchor_3_235" id="FNanchor_3_235" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_235" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> while Saisset thinks
that Agrippa was also the author of these,<a name="FNanchor_4_236"
id="FNanchor_4_236" /><a href="#Footnote_4_236" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> which is a strange theory to propound, as some
of the material of the five is repeated in the two, and the same
man could certainly not appear as an advocate of five, and at the
same time of two Tropes.</p>

<p>The two Tropes are founded on the principle that anything must
be known through itself or through something else. It cannot be
known through itself, because of the discord existing between all
things of the senses and intellect, nor can it be known through
something else, as then either the <i>regressus in infinitum</i> or
the <i>circulus in probando</i> follow.<a name="FNanchor_1_237" id=
"FNanchor_1_237" /><a href="#Footnote_1_237" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> Diogenes Laertius does not refer to these two
Tropes.</p>

<p>In regard to all these Tropes of the suspension of judgment,
Sextus has well remarked in his introduction to them, that they are
included in the eighth, or that of relation.<a name=

<p><i>The Tropes of Aetiology</i>. The eight Tropes against
causality belong chronologically before the five Tropes of Agrippa,
in the history of the development of sceptical thought. They have a
much closer connection with the spirit of Scepticism than the
Tropes of Agrippa, including, as they do, the fundamental thought
of Pyrrhonism, <i>i.e.</i>, that the phenomena do not reveal the
unknown.</p>

<p>The Sceptics did not deny the phenomena, but they denied that
the phenomena are signs capable of being interpreted, or of
revealing the reality of causes. It is impossible by a research of
the signs to find out the unknown, or the explanation of things, as
the Stoics and Epicureans claim. The theory of Aenesidemus which
lies at the foundation of his eight Tropes against aetiology, is
given to us by Photius as follows:<a name="FNanchor_1_239" id=
"FNanchor_1_239" /><a href="#Footnote_1_239" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> "There are no visible signs of the unknown, and
those who believe in its existence are the victims of a vain
illusion." This statement of Aenesidemus is confirmed by a fuller
explanation of it given later on by Sextus.<a name="FNanchor_2_240"
id="FNanchor_2_240" /><a href="#Footnote_2_240" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> If phenomena are not signs of the unknown there
is no causality, and a refutation of causality is a proof of the
impossibility of science, as all science is the science of causes,
the power of studying causes from effects, or as Sextus calls them,
phenomena.</p>

<p>It is very noticeable to any one who reads the refutation of
causality by Aenesidemus, as given by Sextus,<a name=
"FNanchor_3_241" id="FNanchor_3_241" /><a href="#Footnote_3_241"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that there is no reference to the
strongest argument of modern Scepticism, since the time of Hume,
against causality, namely that the origin of the idea of causality
cannot be so accounted for as to justify our relying upon it as a
form of cognition.<a name="FNanchor_4_242" id="FNanchor_4_242" /><a

<p>I. Since aetiology in general refers to things that are unseen,
it does not give testimony that is incontestable in regard to
phenomena. For example, the Pythagoreans explain the distance of
the planets by a musical proportion.</p>

<p>II. From many equally plausible reasons which might be given for
the same thing, one only is arbitrarily chosen, as some explain the
inundation of the Nile by a fall of snow at its source, while there
could be other causes, as rain, or wind, or the action of the
sun.</p>

<p>III. Things take place in an orderly manner, but the causes
presented do not show any order, as for example, the motion of the
stars is explained by their mutual pressure, which does not take
into account the order that reigns among them.</p>

<p>IV. The unseen things are supposed to take place in the same way
as phenomena, as vision is explained in the same way as the
appearance of images in a dark room.</p>

<p>V. Most philosophers present theories of aetiology which agree
with their own individual hypotheses about the elements, but not
with common and accepted ideas, as to explain the world by atoms
like Epicurus, by homoeomeriae like Anaxagoras, or by matter and
form like Aristotle.</p>

<p>VI. Theories are accepted which agree with individual
hypotheses, and others equally probable are passed by, as
Aristotle's explanation of comets, that they are a collection of
vapors near the earth, because that coincided with his theory of
the universe.</p>

<p>VII. Theories of aetiology are presented which conflict not only
with individual hypotheses, but also with phenomena, as to admit
like Epicurus an inclination or desire of the soul, which was
incompatible with the necessity which he advocated.</p>

<p>VIII. The inscrutable is explained by things equally
inscrutable, as the rising of sap in plants is explained by the
attraction of a sponge for water, a fact contested by some.<a name=

<p>Diogenes does not mention these Tropes in this form, but he
gives a <i>resum&eacute;</i> of the general arguments of the
Sceptics against aetiology,<a name="FNanchor_1_245" id=
"FNanchor_1_245" /><a href="#Footnote_1_245" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> which has less in common with the eight Tropes
of Aenesidemus, than with the presentation of the subject by Sextus
later,<a name="FNanchor_2_246" id="FNanchor_2_246" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_246" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> when he multiplies his
proofs exceedingly to show &mu;&eta;&delta;&#8050;&nu;
&epsilon;&#7990;&nu;&alpha;&iota;
&alpha;&#7988;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&nu;. Although the Tropes of
Aenesidemus have a dialectic rather than an objective character, it
would not seem that he made the distinction, which is so prominent
with Sextus, between the signs
&#8017;&pi;&omicron;&mu;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8049;
and &#7952;&nu;&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8049;,<a
name="FNanchor_3_247" id="FNanchor_3_247" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_247" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> especially as Diogenes
sums up his argument on the subject with the general assertion,
&Sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;
&omicron;&#8016;&kappa; &epsilon;&#7990;&nu;&alpha;&iota;,<a name=
"FNanchor_4_248" id="FNanchor_4_248" /><a href="#Footnote_4_248"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and proceeds to introduce the logical
consequence of the denial of aetiology. The summing up of the
Tropes of Aenesidemus is given as follows, in the
<i>Hypotyposes</i>, by Sextus:&mdash;"A cause in harmony with all
the sects of philosophy, and with Scepticism, and with phenomena,
is perhaps not possible, for the phenomena and the unknown
altogether disagree."<a name="FNanchor_5_249" id=
"FNanchor_5_249" /><a href="#Footnote_5_249" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to remark in connection with the seventh of
these Tropes, that Aenesidemus asserts that causality has only a
subjective value, which from his materialistic standpoint was an
argument against its real existence, and the same argument is used
by Kant to prove that causality is a necessary condition of
thought.<a name="FNanchor_6_250" id="FNanchor_6_250" /><a href=
"#Footnote_6_250" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Chaignet characterises the Tropes of Aenesidemus as false and
sophistical,<a name="FNanchor_7_251" id="FNanchor_7_251" /><a href=
"#Footnote_7_251" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but as Maccoll has well
said, they are remarkable for their judicious and strong criticism,
and are directed against the false method of observing facts
through the light of preconceived opinion.<a name="FNanchor_8_252"
id="FNanchor_8_252" /><a href="#Footnote_8_252" class=
"fnanchor">[8]</a> They have, however, a stronger critical side
than sceptical, and show the positive tendency of the thought of
Aenesidemus.</p>

<p>A paragraph in the First Book of the <i>Hypotyposes</i> which
has given rise to much speculation and many different theories, is
the comparison which Sextus makes of Scepticism with the philosophy
of Heraclitus.<a name="FNanchor_1_253" id="FNanchor_1_253" /><a

&Alpha;&#7984;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&#943;&delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&nu;,

<p>This connection which Aenesidemus is said to have affirmed
between Scepticism and the philosophy of Heraclitus is earnestly
combated by Sextus, who declares that the fact that contradictory
predicates appear to be applicable to the same thing is not a dogma
of the Sceptics, but a fact which presents itself to all men, and
not to the Sceptics only. No one for instance, whether he be a
Sceptic or not, would dare to say that honey does not taste sweet
to those in health, and bitter to those who have the jaundice, so
that Heraclitus begins from a preconception common to all men, as
to us also, and perhaps to the other schools of philosophy as
well.<a name="FNanchor_1_256" id="FNanchor_1_256" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_256" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As the statement
concerning the appearance of contradictory predicates in regard to
the same thing is not an exclusively sceptical one, then Scepticism
is no more a path to the philosophy of Heraclitus than to other
schools of philosophy, or to life, as all use common subject
matter. "But we are afraid that the Sceptical School not only does
not help towards the knowledge of the philosophy of Heraclitus, but
even hinders that result. Since the Sceptic accuses Heraclitus of
having rashly dogmatised, presenting on the one hand the doctrine
of 'conflagration' and on the other that 'contradictory predicates
are in reality applicable to the same thing.'"<a name=

class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "It is absurd, then, to say that this
conflicting school is a path to the sect with which it conflicts.
It is therefore absurd to say that the Sceptical School is a path
to the philosophy of Heraclitus."<a name="FNanchor_3_258" id=

<p>This is not the only place in the writings of Sextus which
states that Aenesidemus at some time of his life was an advocate of
the doctrines of Heraclitus. In no instance, however, where Sextus
refers to this remarkable fact, does he offer any explanation of
it, or express any bitterness against Aenesidemus, whom he always
speaks of with respect as a leader of the Sceptical School. We are
thus furnished with one of the most difficult problems of ancient
Scepticism, the problem of reconciling the apparent advocacy of
Aenesidemus of the teachings of Heraclitus with his position in the
Sceptical School.</p>

<p>A comparison with each other of the references made by Sextus
and other writers to the teachings of Aenesidemus, and a
consideration of the result, gives us two pictures of Aenesidemus
which conflict most decidedly with each other. We have on the one
hand, the man who was the first to give Pyrrhonism a position as an
influential school, and the first to collect and present to the
world the results of preceding Sceptical thought. He was the
compiler of the ten Tropes of &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;, and
perhaps in part their author, and the author of the eight Tropes
against aetiology.<a name="FNanchor_1_259" id="FNanchor_1_259" /><a
href="#Footnote_1_259" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He develops his
Scepticism from the standpoint that neither the senses nor the
intellect can give us any certain knowledge of reality.<a name=
"FNanchor_2_260" id="FNanchor_2_260" /><a href="#Footnote_2_260"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He denied the possibility of studying
phenomena as signs of the unknown.<a name="FNanchor_3_261" id=
"FNanchor_3_261" /><a href="#Footnote_3_261" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> He denied all possibility of truth, and the
reality of motion, origin and decay. There was according to his
teaching no pleasure or happiness, and no wisdom or supreme good.
He denied the possibility of finding out the nature of things, or
of proving the existence of the gods, and finally he declared that
no ethical aim is possible.</p>

</div>

<p>The picture on the other hand, presented to us by Sextus and
Tertullian, is that of a man with a system of beliefs and dogmas,
which lead, he says, to the philosophy of Heraclitus. In strange
contradiction to his assertion of the impossibility of all
knowledge, he advocates a theory that the original substance is
air,<a name="FNanchor_1_262" id="FNanchor_1_262" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_262" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which is most certainly
a dogma, although indeed a deviation from the teachings of
Heraclitus, of which Sextus seemed unconscious, as he says,
&tau;&#8056; &tau;&epsilon; &#8004;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8048;
&tau;&#8056;&nu;
&#7977;&rho;&#8049;&kappa;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&tau;&omicron;&nu;
&#7936;&#942;&rho; &#7952;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&nu;, &#8033;&sigmaf;
&phi;&eta;&sigma;&#8054;&nu; &#8001;
&Alpha;&#7984;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&#943;&delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;.
Aenesidemus dogmatised also regarding number and time and unity of
the original world-stuff.<a name="FNanchor_2_263" id=
"FNanchor_2_263" /><a href="#Footnote_2_263" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> He seems to have dogmatised further about
motion,<a name="FNanchor_3_264" id="FNanchor_3_264" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_264" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and about the soul.<a
name="FNanchor_4_265" id="FNanchor_4_265" /><a href=
"#Footnote_4_265" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>If Sextus' language is taken according to its apparent meaning,
we find ourselves here in the presence of a system of beliefs which
would be naturally held by a follower of the Stoic-Heraclitan
physics,<a name="FNanchor_5_266" id="FNanchor_5_266" /><a href=
"#Footnote_5_266" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and absolutely
inexplicable from the standpoint of a man who advocated so radical
a Scepticism as Aenesidemus. Sextus in the passage that we first
quoted,<a name="FNanchor_6_267" id="FNanchor_6_267" /><a href=
"#Footnote_6_267" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> expresses great
indignation against the idea that Scepticism could form the path to
the philosophy of Heraclitus, but he does not express surprise or
indignation against Aenesidemus personally, or offer any
explanation of the apparent contradiction; and while his writings
abound in references to him as a respected leader of the Sceptical
School, he sometimes seems to include him with the Dogmatics,
mentioning him with the
&delta;&omicron;&gamma;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8182;&nu;
&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;&#972;&phi;&omega;&nu;. <a name=
"FNanchor_7_268" id="FNanchor_7_268" /><a href="#Footnote_7_268"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In fact, the task of presenting any
consistent history of the development of thought through which
Aenesidemus passed is such a puzzling one, that Brochard
brilliantly remarks that possibly the best attitude to take towards
it would be to follow the advice of Aenesidemus himself, and
suspend one's judgment altogether regarding it. Is it possible to
suppose that so sharp and subtle a thinker as Aenesidemus held at
the same time such opposing opinions?</p>

<p>The conjecture that he was first a Heraclitan Stoic, and later a
Sceptic, which might be possible, does not offer any explanation of
Sextus' statement, that he regarded Scepticism as a path to the
philosophy of Heraclitus. Nor would it be logical to think that
after establishing the Sceptical School in renewed influence and
power, he reverted to the Heraclitan theories as they were modified
by the Stoics. These same theories were the cause of his separation
from the Academy, for his chief accusation against the Academy was
that it was adopting the dogmatism of the Stoics.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_269" id="FNanchor_1_269" /><a href="#Footnote_1_269"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The matter is complicated by the fact that
Tertullian also attributes to Aenesidemus anthropological and
physical teachings that agree with the Stoical Heraclitan
doctrines. It is not strange that in view of these contradictory
assertions in regard to the same man, some have suggested the
possibility that they referred to two different men of the same
name, a supposition, however, that no one has been able to
authoritatively vindicate.</p>

<p>Let us consider briefly some of the explanations which have been
attempted of the apparent heresy of Aenesidemus towards the
Sceptical School. We will begin with the most ingenious, that of
Pappenheim.<a name="FNanchor_2_270" id="FNanchor_2_270" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_270" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Pappenheim claims that Sextus was not referring to Aenesidemus
himself in these statements which he joins with his name. In the
most important of these, the one quoted from the
<i>Hypotyposes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_271" id=
"FNanchor_3_271" /><a href="#Footnote_3_271" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> which represents Aenesidemus as claiming that
Scepticism is the path to the philosophy of Heraclitus, the
expression used is &omicron;&#7985; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054;
&tau;&#8056;&nu;
&Alpha;&#7984;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&#943;&delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&nu;,
and in many of the other places where Sextus refers to the dogmatic
statements of Aenesidemus, the expression is either
&omicron;&#7985; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &tau;&#8056;&nu;
&Alpha;&#7984;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&#943;&delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&nu;,
or
&Alpha;&#7984;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&#943;&delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&#8125;
&#7977;&rho;&#8049;&kappa;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&tau;&omicron;&nu;,
while when Sextus quotes Aenesidemus to sustain Scepticism, he uses
his name alone.</p>

<p>Pappenheim thinks that Sextus' conflict was not with the dead
Aenesidemus, who had lived two centuries before him, but with his
own contemporaries. He also seeks to prove that Sextus could not
have gained his knowledge of these sayings of Aenesidemus from any
of Aenesidemus' own writings, as neither by the ancients, nor by
later writers, was any book spoken of which could well have
contained them. Neither Aristocles nor Diogenes mentions any such
book.</p>

<p>Pappenheim also makes much of the argument that Sextus in no
instance seems conscious of inconsistency on the part of
Aenesidemus, even when most earnestly combating his alleged
teachings, but in referring to him personally he always speaks of
him with great respect.</p>

<p>Pappenheim suggests, accordingly, that the polemic of Sextus was
against contemporaries, those who accepted the philosophy of
Heraclitus in consequence of, or in some connection with, the
teachings of Aenesidemus. He entirely ignores the fact that there
is no trace of any such school or sect in history, calling
themselves followers of "Aenesidemus according to Heraclitus," but
still thinks it possible that such a movement existed in Alexandria
at the time of Sextus, where so many different sects were found.
Sextus use Aenesidemus' name in four different ways:&mdash;alone,

<p>Pappenheim advances the theory that some of these contemporaries
against whom Sextus directed his arguments had written a book
entitled
&Alpha;&#7984;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&#943;&delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&#8125;
&#7977;&rho;&#8049;&kappa;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&tau;&omicron;&nu;,
to prove the harmony between Aenesidemus and Heraclitus, and that
it was from this book that Sextus quoted the dogmatic statements
which he introduced with that formula. He claims, further, that the
passage quoted from <i>Hypotyposes I.</i> even, is directed against
contemporaries, who founded their system of proofs of the harmony
between Aenesidemus and Heraclitus on the connection of the
celebrated formula which was such a favourite with the Sceptics:
"Contrary predicates appear to apply to the same thing," with the
apparent deduction from this, that "Contrary predicates in reality
apply to the same thing." Sextus wishes, according to Pappenheim,
to prove to these contemporaries that they had misunderstood
Aenesidemus, and Sextus does not report Aenesidemus to be a
Dogmatic, nor to have taught the doctrines of Heraclitus; neither
has he misunderstood Aenesidemus, nor consequently misrepresented
him; but on the contrary, these dogmatic quotations have nothing to
do with Aenesidemus, but refer altogether to contemporaries who
pretended to be Sceptics while they accepted the teachings of
Heraclitus. Sextus naturally warmly combats this tendency, as he
wishes to preserve Pyrrhonism pure.</p>

<p>Brochard advocates a change of opinion on the part of
Aenesidemus as an explanation of the difficulty in question.<a
name="FNanchor_1_273" id="FNanchor_1_273" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_273" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He starts from the
supposition, the reasonableness of which we shall consider later,
that Aenesidemus had passed through one change of opinion already
when he severed his connection with the New Academy; and to the two
phases of his life, which such a change has already made us
familiar with, he adds a third. Aenesidemus would not be the first
who has accepted different beliefs at different periods of his
life, and Brochard claims that such a development in the opinions
of Aenesidemus is logical. He does not accuse Aenesidemus of
having, as might seem from the perusal of Sextus, suddenly changed
his basis, but rather of having gradually come to accept much in
the teachings of Heraclitus. Aenesidemus modifies his Scepticism
only to the extent of pretending to know something of absolute
reality. The Sceptic says, "Contradictory predicates are apparently
applicable to the same thing," and Aenesidemus accepts the
Heraclitan result&mdash;"Contradictory predicates are in reality
applicable to the same thing." From Sextus' report, Aenesidemus
would seem to have renounced his position as a Sceptic in saying
that Scepticism is the path to the philosophy of Heraclitus. He
does not, however, renounce Scepticism, but he finds it incomplete.
In deliberating concerning the appearance of contradictory
predicates in regard to the same object, he would naturally ask,
"Whence come these contradictory appearances?" After having doubted
all things, he wished to know wherefore he doubts. The system of
Heraclitus offers a solution, and he accepts it. Contradictory
predicates produce equilibrium in the soul because they are an
expression of reality.</p>

</div>

<p>As a Sceptic he claims that knowledge is impossible, and he does
not find that the statement of Heraclitus disproves this, but
rather that it supports his theory. He had denied the existence of
science. He still does so, but now he knows why he denies it.
Brochard asks why it is any more impossible that Aenesidemus should
have been a follower of Heraclitus than that Protagoras was so, as
Protagoras was after all a Sceptic. In conclusion, Brochard claims
that the dogmatic theories attributed to Aenesidemus relate to the
doctrine of the truth of contradictory predicates, which seemed to
him a logical explanation of the foundation theories of Scepticism.
It is right to call him a Sceptic, for he was so, and that
sincerely; and he deserves his rank as one of the chiefs of the
Sceptical School.</p>

<p>Coming now to the opinion of Zeller,<a name="FNanchor_1_274" id=
"FNanchor_1_274" /><a href="#Footnote_1_274" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> we find that he advocates a misconception of
Aenesidemus on the part of Sextus. The whole difficulty is removed,
Zeller thinks, by the simple fact that Sextus had not understood
Aenesidemus; and as Tertullian and Sextus agree in this
misconception of the views of Aenesidemus, they must have been
misled by consulting a common author in regard to Aenesidemus, who
confused what Aenesidemus said of Heraclitus with his own opinion.
Zeller maintains that the expression so often repeated by
Sextus&mdash;&Alpha;&#7984;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&#943;&delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&#8125;
&#7977;&rho;&#8049;&kappa;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&tau;&omicron;&nu;
&mdash;shows that some one of Aenesidemus' books contained a report
of Heraclitus' doctrines, as Aenesidemus was in the habit of
quoting as many authorities as possible to sustain his Scepticism.
To justify his quotations from Heraclitus, he had possibly given a
short abstract of Heraclitus' teachings; and the misconception
advocated by Zeller and found both in Tertullian and Sextus, refers
rather to the spirit than to the words quoted from Aenesidemus, and
is a misconception due to some earlier author, who had given a
false impression of the meaning of Aenesidemus in quoting what
Aenesidemus wrote about Heraclitus. That is to say, Heraclitus was
classed by Aenesidemus only among those who prepared the way for
Scepticism, just as Diogenes<a name="FNanchor_2_275" id=
"FNanchor_2_275" /><a href="#Footnote_2_275" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> mentions many philosophers in that way; and that
Soranus<a name="FNanchor_3_276" id="FNanchor_3_276" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_276" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Sextus both had the
same misunderstanding can only be explained by a mistake on the
part of the authority whom they consulted.</p>

<p>This explanation, however, makes Sextus a very stupid man.
Aenesidemus' books were well known, and Sextus would most certainly
take the trouble to read them. His reputation as an historian would
not sustain such an accusation, as Diogenes calls his books

<p>Sextus' references to Aenesidemus in connection with Heraclitus
are very numerous, and it is absurd to suppose that he would have
trusted entirely to some one who reported him for authority on such
a subject. Even were it possible that Sextus did not refer directly
to the works of Aenesidemus, which we do not admit, even then,
there had been many writers in the Sceptical School since the time
of Aenesidemus, and they certainly could not all have
misrepresented him. We must remember that Sextus was at the head of
the School, and had access to all of its literature. His honor
would not allow of such a mistake, and if he had indeed made it,
his contemporaries must surely have discovered it before Diogenes
characterised his books as
&kappa;&#8049;&lambda;&lambda;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;. Whatever
may be said against the accuracy of Sextus as a general historian
of philosophy, especially in regard to the older schools, he cannot
certainly be accused of ignorance respecting the school of which he
was at that time the head.</p>

<p>The opinion of Ritter on this subject is that Aenesidemus must
have been a Dogmatic.<a name="FNanchor_1_280" id=
"FNanchor_1_280" /><a href="#Footnote_1_280" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> Saisset contends<a name="FNanchor_2_281" id=
"FNanchor_2_281" /><a href="#Footnote_2_281" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> that Aenesidemus really passed from the
philosophy of Heraclitus to that of Pyrrho, and made the statement
that Scepticism is the path to the philosophy of Heraclitus to
defend his change of view, although in his case the change had been
just the opposite to the one he defends. Saisset propounds as a law
in the history of philosophy a fact which he claims to be true,
that Scepticism always follows sensationalism, for which he gives
two examples, Pyrrho, who was first a disciple of Democritus, and
Hume, who was a disciple of Locke It is not necessary to discuss
the absurdity of such a law, which someone has well remarked would
involve an <i>a priori</i> construction of history. There is no
apparent reason for Saisset's conjecture in regard to Aenesidemus,
for it is exactly the opposite of what Sextus has reported. Strange
to say, Saisset himself remarks in another place that we owe
religious respect to any text, and that it should be the first law
of criticism to render this.<a name="FNanchor_3_282" id=
"FNanchor_3_282" /><a href="#Footnote_3_282" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> Such respect to the text of Sextus, as he
himself advocates, puts Saisset's explanation of the subject under
discussion out of the question.</p>

<p>Hirzel and Natorp do not find such a marked contradiction in the
two views presented of the theories of Aenesidemus, nor do they
think that Sextus has misrepresented them. They rather maintain,
that in declaring the coexistence of contradictory predicates
regarding the same object, Aenesidemus does not cease to be a
Sceptic, for he did not believe that the predicates are applicable
in a dogmatic sense of the word, but are only applicable in
appearance, that is, applicable to phenomena. The Heraclitism of
Aenesidemus would be then only in appearance, as he understood the
statement, that "Contradictory predicates are in reality applicable
to the same thing," only in the phenomenal sense.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_283" id="FNanchor_1_283" /><a href="#Footnote_1_283"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Hirzel says in addition, that
contradictory predicates are in reality applicable to those
phenomena which are the same for all, and consequently true, for
Aenesidemus considered those phenomena true that are the same for
all.<a name="FNanchor_2_284" id="FNanchor_2_284" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_284" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> As Protagoras, the
disciple of Heraclitus, declared the relative character of
sensations, that things exist only for us, and that their nature
depends on our perception of them; so, in the phenomenal sense,
Aenesidemus accepts the apparent fact that contradictory predicates
in reality apply to the same thing.</p>

<p>This explanation entirely overlooks the fact that we have to do
with the word &#8017;&pi;&#8049;&rho;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;, in
the statement that contradictory predicates in reality apply to the
same thing; while in the passage quoted where Aenesidemus declares
common phenomena to be true ones, we have the word
&#7936;&lambda;&eta;&theta;&#8134;, so that this explanation of the
difficulty would advocate a very strange use of the word
&#8017;&pi;&#8049;&rho;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;.</p>

<p>All of these different views of the possible solution of this
perplexing problem are worthy of respect, as the opinion of men who
have given much thought to this and other closely Belated subjects.
While we may not altogether agree with any one of them, they
nevertheless furnish many suggestions, which are very valuable in
helping to construct a theory on the subject that shall
satisfactorily explain the difficulties, and present a consistent
view of the attitude of Aenesidemus.</p>

<p>First, in regard to the Greek expression &omicron;&#7985;
&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; in connection with proper names, upon
which Pappenheim bases so much of his argument. All Greek scholars
would agree that the expression does not apply usually only to the
disciples of any teacher, but &omicron;&#7985;
&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &tau;&#8056;&nu;
&Alpha;&#7984;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&#943;&delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&nu;,
for instance, includes Aenesidemus with his followers, and is
literally translated, "Aenesidemus and his followers." It is
noticeable, however, in the writings of Sextus that he uses the
expression &omicron;&#7985; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; often for the
name of the founder of a school alone, as Pappenheim himself
admits.<a name="FNanchor_1_285" id="FNanchor_1_285" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_285" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We find examples of this
in the mention of Plato and Democritus and Arcesilaus, as
&omicron;&#7985; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &tau;&#8056;&nu;
&Pi;&lambda;&#8049;&tau;&omega;&nu;&alpha; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054;
&Delta;&eta;&mu;&#972;&kappa;&rho;&iota;&tau;&omicron;&nu; <a name=
"FNanchor_2_286" id="FNanchor_2_286" /><a href="#Footnote_2_286"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and &omicron;&#7985;
&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &tau;&#8056;&nu;
&#7944;&rho;&kappa;&epsilon;&sigma;&#943;&lambda;&alpha;&omicron;&nu;,
<a name="FNanchor_3_287" id="FNanchor_3_287" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_287" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and accordingly we have
no right to infer that his use of the name Aenesidemus in this way
has an exceptional significance. It may mean Aenesidemus alone, or
it may signify Aenesidemus in connection with his followers.</p>

<p>In reply to Zeller's position, that Sextus and Tertullian have
misunderstood Aenesidemus, and quote from some common author who
misrepresents him, we would admit that such a misunderstanding
might be possible where Sextus gives long explanations of
Heraclitus' teachings, beginning with quoting Aenesidemus, and
continuing in such a way that it is not always possible to
distinguish just the part that is attributed to Aenesidemus; but
such a misunderstanding certainly cannot be asserted in regard to
the direct statement that Aenesidemus regarded Scepticism as the
path to the philosophy of Heraclitus, for the reasons previously
given. Neither would we agree with Brochard, whose solution of the
difficulty is on the whole the most logical, <i>i.e.</i>, that
Aenesidemus had necessarily already passed through two phases of
philosophical belief. It is possible to admit a gradual evolution
of thought in Aenesidemus without supposing in either case a change
of basis. His withdrawal from the Academy is an argument against,
rather than in favor of a change on his part, and was caused by the
well-known change in the attitude of the Academy.</p>

<p>Many of the teachings of the Sceptical School were taken
directly from the Academy, belonging to those doctrines advocated
in the Academy before the eclectic dogmatic tendency introduced by
Antiochus. In fact, Sextus himself claims a close relation between
the Middle Academy and Pyrrhonism.<a name="FNanchor_1_288" id=
"FNanchor_1_288" /><a href="#Footnote_1_288" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> Aenesidemus, although he was a Sceptic, belonged
to the Academy, and on leaving it became, as it were, a pioneer in
Pyrrhonism, and cannot be judged in the same way as we should judge
a Sceptic of Sextus' time.</p>

<p>It seems a self-evident fact that during the two centuries which
elapsed between the time of Aenesidemus and Sextus, the standpoint
of judgment in the Sceptical School had greatly changed. An example
illustrating this change we find in a comparison of the
presentation of Scepticism by Diogenes with that of Sextus. The
author Whom Diogenes follows, probably one of the Sceptical
writers, considers Xenophanes, Zeno, and Democritus, Sceptics, and
also Plato,<a name="FNanchor_2_289" id="FNanchor_2_289" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_289" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> while Sextus, in regard
to all of these men, opposes the idea that they were Sceptics.<a
name="FNanchor_3_290" id="FNanchor_3_290" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_290" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Diogenes also calls
Heraclitus a Sceptic, and even Homer,<a name="FNanchor_4_291" id=
"FNanchor_4_291" /><a href="#Footnote_4_291" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> and quotes sceptical sayings from the Seven Wise
Men;<a name="FNanchor_5_292" id="FNanchor_5_292" /><a href=
"#Footnote_5_292" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> he includes in the list

name="FNanchor_6_293" id="FNanchor_6_293" /><a href=
"#Footnote_6_293" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and, furthermore, says
that Theodosius, probably one of the younger Sceptics, objected to
the name 'Pyrrhonean' on the ground that Pyrrho was not the first
Sceptic.<a name="FNanchor_7_294" id="FNanchor_7_294" /><a href=

<p>We have given the testimony from many sources to the effect that
before the time of Sextus the Empirical School of Medicine was
considered identical with Scepticism, although not so by Sextus
himself. From all of these things we may infer a narrowing of the
limits of Pyrrhonism in the time of Sextus.</p>

<p>Let us accept with Brochard the development of thought seen in
Aenesidemus from the beginning to the end of his career, without
agreeing with him that Aenesidemus ever consciously changed his
basis. He was a Sceptic in the Academy. He left the Academy on that
account, and he remained a Sceptic to the end, in so far as a man
can be a Sceptic, and take the positive stand that Aenesidemus
did.</p>

<p>Two things might account for his apparent dogmatism&mdash;</p>

<td class="cell_mid">The psychological effect upon himself of this

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Let us consider the first of these causes. Aenesidemus, although
not the first of the later Sceptics, was apparently the first to
separate himself from the Academy. He was the founder of a new
movement, the attempt to revive the older Scepticism as taught by
Pyrrho and Timon, and separate it from the dogmatic teachings of
the Stoics which were so greatly affecting the Scepticism of the
New Academy. It was the spirit of his time to seek to sustain all
philosophical teaching by the authority of as many as possible of
the older philosophers, and he could hardly escape the tendency
which his training in the Academy had unconsciously given him.
Therefore we find him trying to prove that the philosophy of
Heraclitus follows from Scepticism. It is not necessary either to
explain the matter, as both Hirzel and Natorp so ingeniously
attempt to do, by claiming that the truth of contradictory
predicates which Aenesidemus accepted from Heraclitus referred only
to phenomena. The history of philosophy gives us abundant proof of
the impossibility of absolute Scepticism, and Aenesidemus furnishes
us with one example of many of this impossibility, and of the
dogmatism that must exist in connection with all thought. In the
case of Aenesidemus, who evidently gave the best efforts of his
life to establish the Sceptical School, the dogmatism was probably
unconscious. That he remained to the end a Sceptic is shown by the
fact that he was known as such to posterity. Nowhere do we find a
change of basis referred to in regard to him, and Sextus, in
refuting the mistakes which he attributes to Aenesidemus, does it,
as it were, to point out something of which Aenesidemus had been
unconscious.</p>

<p>Let us consider here the second cause of Aenesidemus' Dogmatism,
the psychological effect upon himself of formulating Sceptical
beliefs. The work that he did for the Sceptical School was a
positive one. It occupied years of his life, and stamped itself
upon his mental development. In formulating Scepticism, and in
advocating it against the many enemies of the School, and amidst
all the excitement of the disruption from the Academy, and of
establishing a new School, it was inevitable that his mind should
take a dogmatic tendency. He remained a Sceptic as he had always
been, but must have grown dogmatic in his attitude towards the
Sceptical formulae, and was thus able to adopt some of the
teachings of Heraclitus, unconscious of their inconsistency.</p>

<p>Where should we find a modern writer who is consistent in all
his statements? Could we read the works of Aenesidemus, we might
better understand the connection between the apparently
contradictory ideas in his teaching, but the inconsistencies in
statement would probably remain. It is necessary to remember the
position of Aenesidemus in breaking away from the Academy and in
founding a new school, the full significance of which he could not
foresee. There must necessarily be some crudeness in pioneer work,
and some failure to see the bearing of all its parts, and a
compiler like Sextus could point out the inconsistencies which the
two centuries since the time of Aenesidemus had made plain.
Aenesidemus was too positive a character to admit of absolute
Sceptical consistency. He was nevertheless the greatest thinker the
Sceptical School had known since the age of Pyrrho, its founder. In
claiming a union between Pyrrhonism and the philosophy of
Heraclitus, he recognised also the pre-Socratic tendency of the
Sceptical School. The name of Socrates was all powerful in the
Academy, but Aenesidemus comprehended the fact that the true spirit
of Pyrrhonism was of earlier origin than the Academic Scepsis.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Critical Examination of
Pyrrhonism</i>.</div>

<p>The distinct philosophical movement of which Pyrrho was the
author bore his name for five centuries after his death. It had an
acknowledged existence as a philosophical tendency, if indeed not a
sect, for a great part of that time. Yet, when we carefully analyse
the relation of Pyrrhonism, as presented to us by Sextus, to the
teachings of Pyrrho himself, in so far as they can be known, we
find many things in Pyrrhonism for which Pyrrho was not
responsible.</p>

<p>The foundation elements of the movement, the spirit of Empirical
doubt that lay underneath and caused its development in certain
directions rather than others, are due to Pyrrho. The methods of
the school, however, were very foreign to anything found in the
life or teachings of Pyrrho. Pyrrho was eminently a moralist. He
was also to a great degree an ascetic, and he lived his philosophy,
giving it thus a positive side wanting in the Pyrrhonism presented
to us by Sextus. Timon represents him as desiring to escape from
the tedious philosophical discussions of his time&mdash;</p>

<p>Pyrrho wished more than anything else to live in peace, and his
dislike of the Sophists<a name="FNanchor_2_296" id=
"FNanchor_2_296" /><a href="#Footnote_2_296" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> may well have made him try to avoid dialectic;
while, on the contrary, in the Pyrrhonean School of later times
discussion was one of the principal methods of contest, at least
after the time of Agrippa. Pyrrhonism seems to have been originally
a theory of life, like the philosophy of Socrates, to whom Pyrrho
is often compared,<a name="FNanchor_3_297" id="FNanchor_3_297" /><a
href="#Footnote_3_297" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Pyrrho, like
Socrates, lived his philosophy. Our knowledge of Pyrrho is gained
from Aristocles, Sextus Empiricus, and Diogenes, and from the
Academic traditions given by Cicero. Diogenes gives us details of
his life which he attributes to Antigonus of Carystius, who lived
about the time of Pyrrho.<a name="FNanchor_4_298" id=
"FNanchor_4_298" /><a href="#Footnote_4_298" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> Pyrrho was a disciple and admirer of
Democritus,<a name="FNanchor_5_299" id="FNanchor_5_299" /><a href=
"#Footnote_5_299" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> some of whose teachings
bore a lasting influence over the subsequent development of
Pyrrhonism. He accompanied Alexander the Great to India, where he
remained as a member of his suite for some time, and the
philosophical ideas of India were not without influence on his
teachings. Oriental philosophy was not unknown in Greece long
before the time of Pyrrho, but his personal contact with the Magi
and the Gymnosophists of the far East, apparently impressed upon
his mind teachings for which he was not unprepared by his previous
study and natural disposition. In his indifference to worldly goods
we find a strong trace of the Buddhistic teaching regarding the
vanity of human life. He showed also a similar hopelessness in
regard to the possibility of finding a satisfactory philosophy, or
absolute truth. He evidently returned from India with the
conviction that truth was not to be attained.<a name=

<p>After the death of Alexander and Pyrrho's return to Greece, he
lived quietly with his sister at Elis, and Diogenes says that he
was consistent in his life, asserting and denying nothing, but in
everything withholding his opinion, as nothing in itself is good or
shameful, just or unjust.<a name="FNanchor_1_301" id=
"FNanchor_1_301" /><a href="#Footnote_1_301" class=

animals in the market place, and, if necessary, washed the utensils
himself.<a name="FNanchor_2_302" id="FNanchor_2_302" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_302" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He lived in equality of
spirit, and practised his teachings with serenity. If one went out
while he was talking he paid no attention, but went calmly on with
his remarks.<a name="FNanchor_3_303" id="FNanchor_3_303" /><a href=
"#Footnote_3_303" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He liked to live alone,
and to travel alone, and on one occasion, being knocked about in a
vessel by a storm at sea, he did not lose his imperturbability, but
pointed to a swine calmly eating on board, and said that the wise
man should have as much calmness of soul as that. He endured
difficult surgical operations with indifference,<a name=
"FNanchor_4_304" id="FNanchor_4_304" /><a href="#Footnote_4_304"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and when his friend Anaxarchus was once
unfortunate enough to fall into a morass, he went calmly by without
stopping to help him, for which consistency of conduct Anaxarchus
afterwards praised him. There are two instances given by Diogenes
when he lost control of himself; once in getting angry with his
sister, and once in trying to save himself when chased by a dog.
When accused of inconsistency, he said it was difficult to entirely
give up one's humanity.<a name="FNanchor_5_305" id=

"fnanchor">[6]</a> and after his death erected a statue to his
memory. These facts testify to his moral character, and also to
fulfil the functions of high priest a certain amount of dogmatism
must have been necessary.</p>

<p>According to Diogenes, "We cannot know," said Pyrrho, "what
things are in themselves, either by sensation or by judgment, and,
as we cannot distinguish the true from the false, therefore we
should live impassively, and without an opinion." The term
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;, so characteristic of Pyrrhonism,
goes back, according to Diogenes, to the time of Pyrrho.<a name=

<p>The picture given of Pyrrho by Cicero is entirely different from
that of Diogenes, and contrasts decidedly with it.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_311" id="FNanchor_1_311" /><a href="#Footnote_1_311"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Cicero knows Pyrrho as a severe moralist,
not as a Sceptic. Both authors attribute to Pyrrho the doctrine of
indifference and apathy, but, according to Cicero, Pyrrho taught of
virtue, honesty, and the <i>summum bonum</i>, while Diogenes
plainly tells us that he considered nothing as good in itself, "and
of all things nothing as true."<a name="FNanchor_2_312" id=
"FNanchor_2_312" /><a href="#Footnote_2_312" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> Cicero does not once allude to Pyrrhonean doubt.
We see on the one hand, in Cicero's idea of Pyrrho, the influence
of the Academy, perhaps even of Antiochus himself,<a name=
"FNanchor_3_313" id="FNanchor_3_313" /><a href="#Footnote_3_313"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which probably colored the representations
given of Pyrrho; but, on the other hand, there is much in Diogenes'
account of Pyrrho's life and teachings, and in the writings of
Timon, which shows us the positive side of Pyrrho. Pyrrho, in
denying the possibility of all knowledge, made that rather a motive
for indifference in the relations of life, than the foundation
thought of a philosophical system. His teaching has a decided
ethical side, showing in that respect the strong influence of
Democritus over him, who, like Pyrrho, made happiness to consist in
a state of feeling.<a name="FNanchor_4_314" id=
"FNanchor_4_314" /><a href="#Footnote_4_314" class=

"#Footnote_1_316" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The problem of
philosophy is here proposed very nearly in the terms of Kant, but
not with the positive motive, like that of the great philosopher of
Germany, of evolving a system to present the truth. Yet the
importance of these questions shows the originality of Pyrrho. The
earnestness of Pyrrho is further shown by an example given by
Diogenes. Once on being found talking to himself alone, he said,
when asked the reason, that he was meditating how to become a good
man (&chi;&rho;&eta;&sigma;&tau;&#972;&sigmaf;), <a name=
"FNanchor_2_317" id="FNanchor_2_317" /><a href="#Footnote_2_317"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> thus showing an entirely different spirit
from anything found in Sextus' books. The explanation of his life
and teachings is to be found largely in his own disposition. Such
an attitude of indifference must belong to a placid nature, and
cannot be entirely the result of a philosophical system, and, while
it can be aimed at, it can never be perfectly imitated. One of his
disciples recognised this, and said that it was necessary to have
the disposition of Pyrrho in order to hold his doctrines.<a name=
"FNanchor_3_318" id="FNanchor_3_318" /><a href="#Footnote_3_318"

advance any formulae of Scepticism,<a name="FNanchor_4_319" id=
"FNanchor_4_319" /><a href="#Footnote_4_319" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> but they must have been very elementary, as
Pyrrho himself wrote nothing. We find no trace of formulated Tropes
in Pyrrho's teachings, yet it is probable that he indicated some of
the contradictions in sensation, and possibly the Tropes in some
rudimentary form. Of the large number of sceptical formulae, or
&phi;&omega;&nu;&alpha;&#943;, the three which seem to have the
oldest connection with Scepticism are the

"FNanchor_7_322" id="FNanchor_7_322" /><a href="#Footnote_7_322"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and the other two mentioned are also
attributed to him by Aristocles.<a name="FNanchor_8_323" id=

attributed to it is shown by Sextus.<a name="FNanchor_9_324" id=
"FNanchor_9_324" /><a href="#Footnote_9_324" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a> So while the expression is the same, the
explanation of it given by Pyrrho must have been different. It
would seem probable that Pyrrho used all of these three sayings,
from the account of Diogenes, and that even then they gave rise to
the accusation of the Dogmatics, that simply by possessing such
sayings the Sceptics dogmatised,<a name="FNanchor_10_325" id=
"FNanchor_10_325" /><a href="#Footnote_10_325" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a> for the refutation of this used by Sextus
occurs in the old account of the sayings, namely, that these
formulae include also themselves in the meaning, as a cathartic
removes itself together with other harmful objects.<a name=

<p>In comparing the later Pyrrhonism with the teachings of Pyrrho,
we would sharply contrast the moral attitude of the two. With
Pyrrho equilibrium of soul was a means to be applied to his
positive theory of life; with the later Pyrrhoneans it was the end
to be attained. We would attribute, however, the empirical tendency
shown during the whole history of Pyrrhonism to Pyrrho as its
originator. He was an empirical philosopher, and the result of his
influence in this respect, as seen in the subsequent development of
the school, stands in marked contrast to the dialectic spirit of
the Academic Scepsis. The empiricism of the school is shown in its
scientific lore, in the fact that so many of the Sceptics were
physicians, and in the character of the ten Tropes of
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;. We may safely affirm that the
foundation principles of Pyrrhonism are due to Pyrrho, and the
originality which gave the school its power. The elaborated
arguments, however, and the details of its formulae belong to later
times.</p>

<p>Coming now to the relation of Pyrrhonism to the Academy, the
connection between the two is difficult to exactly determine,
between the time of Pyrrho and that of Aenesidemus. Scepticism in
the Academy was, however, never absolutely identical with
Pyrrhonism, although at certain periods of the history of the
Academy the difference was slight. We can trace throughout the
evolution of doubt, as shown to us in Pyrrhonism, and in Academic
Scepticism, the different results which followed the difference in
origin of the two movements, and these differences followed
according to general laws of development of thought. Arcesilaus,
who introduced doubt into the Academy, claimed to return to the
dialectic of Socrates, and suppressing the lectures,<a name=
"FNanchor_1_327" id="FNanchor_1_327" /><a href="#Footnote_1_327"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which were the method of teaching in the
later schools of philosophy, introduced discussions instead, as
being more decidedly a Socratic method. Although, according to
Sextus, he was the one leader of the Academy whose Scepticism most
nearly approached that of Pyrrhonism,<a name="FNanchor_2_328" id=
"FNanchor_2_328" /><a href="#Footnote_2_328" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> yet underneath his whole teaching lay that
dialectic principle so thoroughly in opposition to the empiricism
of Pyrrho. The belief of Socrates and Plato in the existence of
absolute truth never entirely lost its influence over the Academy,
but was like a hidden germ, destined to reappear after Scepticism
had passed away. It finally led the Academy back to Dogmatism, and
prepared the way for the Eclecticism with which it disappeared from
history.</p>

<p>The history of Pyrrhonism and that of Academic Scepticism were
for a time contemporaneous. The immediate follower of Pyrrho,
Timon, called by Sextus the "prophet of Pyrrho,"<a name=
"FNanchor_1_329" id="FNanchor_1_329" /><a href="#Footnote_1_329"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was a contemporary of Arcesilaus. That he
did not consider the Scepticism of the Academy identical with
Pyrrhonism is proved from the fact that he did not himself join the
Academy, but was, on the contrary, far from doing so. That he
regarded Arcesilaus as a Dogmatic is evident from his writings.<a
name="FNanchor_2_330" id="FNanchor_2_330" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_330" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> One day, on seeing the
chief of the Academy approaching, he cried out, "What are you doing
here among us who are free?"<a name="FNanchor_3_331" id=
"FNanchor_3_331" /><a href="#Footnote_3_331" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> After the death of Timon, the Pyrrhonean School
had no representative till the time of Ptolemy of Cyrene,<a name=
"FNanchor_4_332" id="FNanchor_4_332" /><a href="#Footnote_4_332"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and Greek Scepticism was represented by
the Academy. That Pyrrho had a strong influence over Arcesilaus,
the founder of the Middle Academy, is evident<a name=
"FNanchor_5_333" id="FNanchor_5_333" /><a href="#Footnote_5_333"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; but there was also never a time when the
Academy entirely broke away from all the teachings of Plato, even
in their deepest doubt.<a name="FNanchor_6_334" id=
"FNanchor_6_334" /><a href="#Footnote_6_334" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> It is true that Arcesilaus removed, nominally as
well as in spirit, some of the dialogues of Plato from the Academy,
but only those that bore a dogmatic character, while those that
presented a more decided Socratic mode of questioning without
reaching any decided result, men regarded as authority for
Scepticism.</p>

<p>Sextus does not deny that Arcesilaus was almost a Pyrrhonean,
but he claims that his Pyrrhonism was only apparent, and not real,
and was used as a cloak to hide his loyalty to the teachings of
Plato.<a name="FNanchor_1_335" id="FNanchor_1_335" /><a href=
"#Footnote_1_335" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As Ariston said of
him,<a name="FNanchor_2_336" id="FNanchor_2_336" /><a href=
"#Footnote_2_336" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "Plato before, Pyrrho
behind, Diodorus in the middle." Sextus also characterises the
method of Arcesilaus as dialectic,<a name="FNanchor_3_337" id=
"FNanchor_3_337" /><a href="#Footnote_3_337" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> and we know from Cicero that it was his pride to
pretend to return to the dialectic of Socrates.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Sextus, in his refutation of the
position that the Academy is the same as Pyrrhonism, takes up the
entire development of Academic thought from the time of Plato till
that of Antiochus, and does not limit the argument to Scepticism
under Arcesilaus. The claim made by some that the two schools were
the same, is stated by him,<a name="FNanchor_4_338" id=
"FNanchor_4_338" /><a href="#Footnote_4_338" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> and the word 'some' probably refers to members
of both schools at different periods of their history. Sextus
recognises three Academies, although he remarks that some make even
a further division, calling that of Philo and Charmides, the
fourth, and that of Antiochus and his followers, the fifth.</p>

<p>That many in the Academy, and even outside of it, regarded Plato
as a Sceptic, and an authority for subsequent Scepticism, we find
both from Sextus and Diogenes.<a name="FNanchor_1_339" id=
"FNanchor_1_339" /><a href="#Footnote_1_339" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> As Lewes justly remarks, one could well find
authority for Scepticism in the works of Plato, as indeed the
Academicians did, but not when the sum total of his teachings was
considered. The spirit of Plato's teachings was dogmatic, as Sextus
most decidedly recognises, and as Aenesidemus and Menodotus<a name=
"FNanchor_2_340" id="FNanchor_2_340" /><a href="#Footnote_2_340"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> recognised before him.<a name=
"FNanchor_3_341" id="FNanchor_3_341" /><a href="#Footnote_3_341"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Sextus himself shows us that Plato's
idealism and ethical teachings can have nothing in common with
Scepticism, for if he accepts the desirability of the virtuous
life, and the existence of Providence, he dogmatises; and if he
even regards them as probable, he gives preference to one set of
ideas over another, and departs from the sceptical character.
Sextus characterises the sceptical side of Plato's writings as
mental gymnastics,<a name="FNanchor_4_342" id="FNanchor_4_342" /><a
href="#Footnote_4_342" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which do not
authorise his being called a Sceptic, and affirms that Plato is not
a Sceptic, since he prefers some unknown things to others in
trustworthiness. The ethical difference underlying the teachings of
the Academy and Pyrrhonism, Sextus was very quick to see, and
although it is very probable that the part of the
<i>Hypotyposes</i> which defines the difference between the Academy
and Pyrrhonism may be largely quoted from the introduction to
Aenesidemus' works, yet Sextus certainly gives these statements the
strong stamp of his approval. He condemns the Academy because of
the theory that good and evil exist, or if this cannot be decidedly
proved, yet that it is more probable that what is called good
exists than the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_5_343" id=

<p>The whole Academic teaching of probabilities contradicted the
standpoint of the Sceptics&mdash;that our ideas are equal as
regards trustworthiness and untrustworthiness,<a name=
"FNanchor_1_344" id="FNanchor_1_344" /><a href="#Footnote_1_344"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for the Academicians declared that some
ideas are probable and some improbable, and they make a difference
even in those ideas that they call probable.</p>

<p>Sextus claims that there are three fundamental grounds of
difference between Pyrrhonism and the Academy. The first is the
doctrine of probability which the Academicians accept in regard to
the superior trustworthiness of some ideas over others.<a name=
"FNanchor_2_345" id="FNanchor_2_345" /><a href="#Footnote_2_345"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The second is the different way in which
the two schools follow their teachers. The Pyrrhoneans follow
without striving or strong effort, or even strong inclination, as a
child follows his teacher, while the Academicians follow with
sympathy and assent, as Carneades and Clitomachus affirm.<a name=
"FNanchor_3_346" id="FNanchor_3_346" /><a href="#Footnote_3_346"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The third difference is in the aim, for
the Academicians follow what is probable in life. The Sceptics
follow nothing, but live according to laws, customs, and natural
feelings undogmatically.<a name="FNanchor_4_347" id=
"FNanchor_4_347" /><a href="#Footnote_4_347" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The difference between the later teaching of the Academy and
Pyrrhonism is evident, and Sextus treats of it briefly, as not
requiring discussion,<a name="FNanchor_5_348" id=
"FNanchor_5_348" /><a href="#Footnote_5_348" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> as Philo taught that the nature of facts is
incomprehensible, and Antiochus transferred the Stoa to the
Academy. It is therefore evident, from the comparison which we have
made, that we do not find in the Academy, with which Scepticism
after the death of Timon was so long united, the exact continuance
of Pyrrhonism. The philosophical enmity of the two contemporaries,
Timon and Arcesilaus, the Academician who had most in common with
Pyrrhonism, is an expression of the fundamental incompatibility
between the two schools.</p>

<p>During all the chequered history of the Academy the dormant
idealism was there, underlying the outward development. Although
during the time of Arcesilaus and Carneades the difference was so
slight as to seem a mere matter of form of expression, yet the
different foundations on which the two schools stood was always
recognisable. On the one hand there was the germ of idealism which
was destined to awake to a new life, and on the other, the attempt
at absolute negation which was to result in the final extinction of
Pyrrhonism. We find in both, it is true, especially in the time of
Arcesilaus, the aim of &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;. <a name=
"FNanchor_1_349" id="FNanchor_1_349" /><a href="#Footnote_1_349"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Both placed great weight on
&#7984;&sigma;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&#941;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;,
or the equal value of opposing arguments. <a name="FNanchor_2_350"
id="FNanchor_2_350" /><a href="#Footnote_2_350" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> The foundation of the
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; was, however, different in the two
cases. Arcesilaus founded his on dialectic, while Pyrrho's was
empirical.</p>

</div>

<p>The Pyrrhonean believed that ideas give us no knowledge of the
outer world; the Academic Sceptic believed that we cannot
distinguish between true and false ideas, so such knowledge is
impossible. The Pyrrhonean denied that truth could exist in ideas
because of their contradictory nature, and consequently the
existence of all truth, &mu;&eta;&delta;&#8050;&nu;

"FNanchor_1_351" id="FNanchor_1_351" /><a href="#Footnote_1_351"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Academic Sceptic granted that the
truth was possibly contained in ideas, but affirmed that it could
never be known to us. The Pyrrhoneans prided themselves on still
being seekers, for although ordinary ideas are too contradictory to
give knowledge of the outer world, they did not deny that such
knowledge might be possible, but simply suspended the judgment
regarding it. To the Pyrrhonean the result corresponded to the
method. All ideas thus far known revealed nothing of the truth,
therefore he still sought. The Academician tried logically to prove
that the truth is impossible to find. It is the relation of the
dialectician to the empiricist, and the two varieties of Scepticism
are explained by their difference in origin. In Pyrrhonism there
was no constructive element. In the Academic Scepsis such an
element was found throughout all its history in the theory of
Probability. Arcesilaus himself laid great stress upon this
doctrine, which Sextus carefully shows us<a name="FNanchor_2_352"
id="FNanchor_2_352" /><a href="#Footnote_2_352" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> is utterly inconsistent with Pyrrhonism.
Arcesilaus plainly teaches that, having suspended one's judgment in
regard to matters of knowledge, one should control his choices, his
refusals, and his actions by the probable.<a name="FNanchor_3_353"

<p>After Antiochus introduced Eclecticism into the Academy,
Pyrrhonism was the only representative of Greek Scepticism, and it
flourished for over two centuries after our era, and then also
disappeared, no more to exist as a regular philosophical
school.</p>

<p>Having considered at length the essence of Pyrrhonism as
presented by Sextus Empiricus, it now remains to briefly note the
characteristics that formed its strength and weakness, and the
causes of its final downfall. Herbart says that every philosopher
is a Sceptic in the beginning, but every Sceptic remains always in
the beginning. This remark may well be applied to Pyrrhonism. We
find in its teachings many fundamental philosophical truths which
might have formed the beginning of great philosophical progress,
but which were never developed to any positive results. The
teachings of Pyrrhonism were some of them well fitted to prepare
the way to idealism. The great idea of the relativity of
<i>Vorstellungen</i> is made very prominent by the ten Tropes of
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;. Aenesidemus, in his eight Tropes
against aetiology, shows the absurdity of the doctrine of causality
when upheld on materialistic grounds. That was to him final,
&#7952;&pi;&epsilon;&#8054; &omicron;&#8016;&kappa;
&#7956;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&iota;
&alpha;&#7988;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&nu;. He could not divine that
although the result which he presented was logical, it only led to
a higher truth. It was reserved for the greatest of modern
philosophers to reveal to the world that causality is a condition,
and a necessary condition, of thought. When Aenesidemus proved by
his seventh Trope that causality is subjective, he regarded it as
fatal to the doctrine; yet this conclusion was a marked step in
advance in critical philosophy, although Aenesidemus could not
himself see it in all its bearings. The great difference between
Aenesidemus and Kant is the difference between the materialist and
the believer in subjective reality. Both agreed in the unknown
nature of the <i>Ding an sich</i>, but this was to the Pyrrhonist
the end of all his philosophy; to Kant, however, the beginning.</p>

<p>Pyrrhonism has rendered, notwithstanding its points of fatal
weakness, marked service to the world in science, philosophy,
ethics, and religion. It quickened scientific thought by
emphasising empirical methods of investigation, and by criticising
all results founded without sufficient data upon false hypotheses.
If, instead of denying the possibility of all science because of
the want of a criterion of the truth of phenomena, the Pyrrhonists
had comprehended the possibility of a science of phenomena, they
might have led the world in scientific progress.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_354" id="FNanchor_1_354" /><a href="#Footnote_1_354"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Their service to philosophy lay in the
stimulus to thought that their frequent attacks on dogmatic beliefs
occasioned. Pyrrhonism brought together all the most prominent
theories of the old schools of philosophy to test their weakness
and expose their contradictions, and this very process of criticism
often demonstrated the power of the truth which they contained.</p>

<p>Sextus Empiricus was often charged by the Church Fathers with
corrupting religious belief, and yet the greatest service which
Pyrrhonism has rendered the world was in religious and ethical
lines. This service did not, naturally, consist in destroying
belief in absolute truth, as the Sceptic professed to do, but in
preparing the way to find it. The bold attacks of Scepticism on all
truth led men to investigate ethical and religious teachings, to
examine the grounds of their belief, and to put in practical use
the right of reason and free discussion.</p>

<p>Scepticism was the antecedent of freedom of conscience and
rational criticism,<a name="FNanchor_2_355" id=
"FNanchor_2_355" /><a href="#Footnote_2_355" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> and the absolute right of scientific thought.
The Sceptics, however, reaped none of the benefits of their own
system. They remained, as it were, always on the threshold of
possible progress. With the keys to great discoveries in their
hands, the doors of philosophical and scientific advancement were
for ever closed to them by the limitations of their own system. The
inherent weakness of Pyrrhonism lay in its psychological
inconsistency and in its negative character. I think that we may
safely say that Pyrrhonism was the most consistent system of
Scepticism ever offered to the world, and yet it proves most
decidedly that complete Scepticism is psychologically impossible. A
man may give up his belief in one set of ideas, and, if they are
ideas that are popularly accepted, he will be called a Sceptic, as
was the case with Hume. He must, however, replace these ideas by
others equally positive, and then he is no longer a Sceptic, but a
Dogmatic, for he believes in something.</p>

<p>We have shown that the greatest thinkers of Pyrrhonism, Pyrrho,
Aenesidemus, and Agrippa, were not examples of absolute Scepticism,
and although Sextus Empiricus realised what consistency demanded in
this respect, and affirmed on almost every page that he was
asserting nothing, yet there is not a paragraph of his books in
which he does not, after all, dogmatise on some subject. Complete
Scepticism is contrary to the fundamental laws of language, as all
use of verbs involves some affirmation. The Pyrrhonists realised
this, and therefore some of them wrote nothing, like Pyrrho, their
leader, and others advocated
&#7936;&phi;&alpha;&sigma;&#943;&alpha;<a name="FNanchor_1_356" id=
"FNanchor_1_356" /><a href="#Footnote_1_356" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> as one of the doctrines of their system.</p>

</div>

<p>The very aim of Pyrrhonism was an inconsistent one.
&#7944;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; was only another
name for happiness, and in one instance, even, is given as
&#7969;&delta;&omicron;&nu;&#942;, and thus, in spite of
themselves, the Sceptics introduced a theory of happiness. Pyrrho,
like others of his time, sought the highest good, and thought that
he had found it in
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha;, the peace of mind
that appears in other systems of philosophy in other forms. The
difference of aim between the Pyrrhonists, Stoics, and Epicureans
was more apparent than real. To them all philosophy was a path to
lead to happiness. The method of Pyrrhonism was, however, negative.
Its strength consisted in its attacks on Dogmatism, and not in any
positive aim of its own, for its positive side could not be
recognised according to its own doctrines. Therefore there was no
real development in Pyrrhonism, for a negative thought cannot be
developed.</p>

<p>We find, accordingly, from the time of Pyrrho to Sextus, no
growth in breadth of philosophical outlook, only improvement in
methods. Philosophical activity can never have doubt as its aim, as
that would form, as we have shown, a psychological contradiction.
The true essence of Pyrrhonism was passivity, but passivity can
never lead to progress. Much of the polemical work of Pyrrhonism
prepared the way for scientific progress by providing a vast store
of scientific data, but progress was to the Pyrrhonists impossible.
They sounded their own scientific death-knell by declaring the
impossibility of science, and putting an end to all theories.</p>

<p>The life of all scientific and philosophic progress is in the
attempt to find the hidden truth. To the Sceptic there was no
truth, and there could be no progress. As progress is a law in the
evolution of the human race, so Scepticism as a philosophy could
never be a permanent growth, any more than asceticism in religion
can be a lasting influence. Both of them are only outgrowths. As
the foundation principles of Scepticism were opposed to anything
like real growth, it was a system that could never originate
anything. Pyrrho taught from the beginning that the Sceptic must
live according to law and custom; not, however, because one law or
custom is better than another in itself, but simply for the sake of
peace. This basis of action was itself a death-blow to all reform
in social or political life. It was a selfish, negative way of
seeking what was, after all, a positive thing, the
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; that the Sceptic
desired. Life with the Pyrrhonist was phenomenal, and not
phenomenal simply in regard to the outer world, but also
subjectively, and no absolute knowledge of the subjective life or
of personal existence was possible.</p>

<p>The cause of the downfall of Pyrrhonism lay in the fact that it
had nothing to offer to humanity in the place of what it had
destroyed. It made no appeal to human sympathies, and ignored all
the highest motives to human action. The especial materialistic
standpoint from which Pyrrhonism judged all that pertains to
knowledge and life shut out the ideal, and all possibility of
absolute truth. It was an expression of the philosophic decadence
of the age when it flourished, and although it possessed some
philosophic worth, yet it bore in itself the causes of its
decay.</p>

<h3>BOOK I.</h3>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Principal Differences between
Philosophers.</i></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">1</span> It is probable that those who
seek after anything whatever, will either find it as they continue
the search, will deny that it can be found and confess it to be out
of reach, or will go on seeking it. Some have said, accordingly, in
regard to the things sought in philosophy, that they <span class=
"pagenum">2</span> have found the truth, while others have declared
it impossible to find, and still others continue to seek it. Those
who think that they have found it are those who are especially
called Dogmatics, as for example, the Schools of Aristotle and
Epicurus, the Stoics and some others. Those who have <span class=
"pagenum">3</span> declared it impossible to find are Clitomachus,
Carneades, with their respective followers, and other Academicians.
Those who still seek it are the Sceptics. It appears therefore,
reasonable to conclude that the three principal kinds <span class=
"pagenum">4</span> of philosophy are the Dogmatic, the Academic,
and the Sceptic. Others may suitably treat of the other Schools,
but as for the Sceptical School, we shall now give an outline of
it, remarking in advance that in respect to nothing that will be
said do we speak positively, that it must be absolutely so, but we
shall state each thing historically as it now appears to us.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Ways of Treating Scepticism.</i></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">5</span> One way of treating the Sceptical
philosophy is called general, and the other special. The general
method is that by which we set forth the character of Scepticism,
declaring what its idea is, what its principles are, its mode of
reasoning, its criterion, and its aim. It presents also, the
aspects of doubt, &omicron;&#943;
&tau;&rho;&#972;&pi;&omicron;&iota; &tau;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&#8050;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#8134;&sigmaf;, and the way in which we
should understand the Sceptical formulae, and the distinction
between Scepticism and the related Schools of philosophy. The
special method, on the contrary, is that by which we <span class=
"pagenum">6</span> speak against each part of so-called philosophy.
Let us then treat Scepticism at first in the general way, beginning
our delineation with the nomenclature of the Sceptical School.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Nomenclature of Scepticism.</i></div>

<p>The Sceptical School is also called the "Seeking School," <span
class="pagenum">7</span> from its spirit of research and
examination; the "Suspending School," from the condition of mind in
which one is left after the search, in regard to the things that he
has examined; and the "Doubting School," either because, as some
say, the Sceptics doubt and are seeking in regard to everything, or
because they never know whether to deny or affirm. It is also
called the Pyrrhonean School, because Pyrrho appears to us the best
representative of Scepticism, and is more prominent than all who
before him occupied themselves with it.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>What is Scepticism?</i></div>

<p>The &delta;&#973;&nu;&alpha;&mu;&iota;&sigmaf; of the Sceptical
School is to place the <span class="pagenum">8</span> phenomenal in
opposition to the intellectual "in any way whatever," and thus
through the equilibrium of the reasons and things
(&#7984;&sigma;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&#941;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;
&tau;&#8182;&nu; &lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omega;&nu;) opposed to each
other, to reach, first the state of suspension of judgment,
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;, and afterwards that of
imperturbability, &#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha;.
We do not use the word &delta;&#973;&nu;&alpha;&mu;&iota;&sigmaf;
in any <span class="pagenum">9</span> unusual sense, but simply,
meaning the force of the system. By the phenomenal, we understand
the sensible, hence we place the intellectual in opposition to it.
The phrase "in any way whatever," may refer to the word
&delta;&#973;&nu;&alpha;&mu;&iota;&sigmaf; in order that we may
understand that word in a simple sense as we said, or it may refer
to the placing the phenomenal and intellectual in opposition. For
we place these in opposition to each other in a variety of ways,
the phenomenal to the phenomenal, and the intellectual to the
intellectual, or reciprocally, and we say "in any way whatever," in
order that all methods of opposition may be included. Or "in any
way whatever" may refer to the phenomenal and the intellectual, so
that we need not ask how does the phenomenal appear, or how are the
thoughts conceived, but that we may understand these things in a
simple sense. By "reasons opposed to each other," we do not by any
means <span class="pagenum">10</span> understand that they deny or
affirm anything, but simply that they offset each other. By
equilibrium, we mean equality in regard to trustworthiness and
untrustworthiness, so that of the reasons that are placed in
opposition to each other, one should not excel another in
trustworthiness. &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; is a holding back
of the opinion, in consequence of which we neither deny nor affirm
anything. &#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; is
repose and tranquillity of soul. We shall explain how
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; accompanies
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; when we speak of the aim.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Sceptic.</i></div>

<p>What is meant by a Pyrrhonean philosopher can be <span class=
"pagenum">11</span> understood from the idea of the Sceptical
School. He is a Pyrrhonean, namely, who identifies himself with
this system.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Origin of Scepticism.</i></div>

<p>Scepticism arose in the beginning from the hope of <span class=
"pagenum">12</span> attaining
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha;; for men of the
greatest talent were perplexed by the contradiction of things, and
being at a loss what to believe, began to question what things are
true, and what false, hoping to attain
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; as a result of the
decision. The fundamental principle of the Sceptical system is
especially this, namely, to oppose every argument by one of equal
weight, for it seems to us that in this way we finally reach the
position where we have no dogmas.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Does the Sceptic Dogmatise?</i></div>

<p>We say that the Sceptic does not dogmatise. We do <span class=
"pagenum">13</span> not say this, meaning by the word dogma the
popular assent to certain things rather than others (for the
Sceptic does assent to feelings that are a necessary result of
sensation, as for example, when he is warm or cold, he cannot say
that he thinks he is not warm or cold), but we say this, meaning by
dogma the acceptance of any opinion in regard to the unknown things
investigated by science. For the Pyrrhonean assents to nothing that
is unknown. Furthermore, <span class="pagenum">14</span> he does
not dogmatise even when he utters the Sceptical formulae in regard
to things that are unknown, such as "Nothing more," or "I decide
nothing," or any of the others about which we shall speak later.
For the one who dogmatises regards the thing about which he is said
to dogmatise, as existing in itself; the Sceptic does not however
regard these formulae as having an absolute existence, for he
assumes that the saying "All is false," includes itself with other
things as false, and likewise the saying "Nothing is true"; in the
same way "Nothing more," states that together with other things it
itself is nothing more, and cancels itself therefore, as well as
other things. We say the same also in regard to the other Sceptical
expressions. In short, if he who dogmatises, assumes as existing in
itself that about which he dogmatises, <span class=
"pagenum">15</span> the Sceptic, on the contrary, expresses his
sayings in such a way that they are understood to be themselves
included, and it cannot be said that he dogmatises in saying these
things. The principal thing in uttering these formulae is that he
says what appears to him, and communicates his own feelings in an
unprejudiced way, without asserting anything in regard to external
objects.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Is Scepticism a Sect?</i></div>

<p>We respond in a similar way if we are asked whether <span class=
"pagenum">16</span> Scepticism is a sect or not. If the word sect
is defined as meaning a body of persons who hold dogmas which are
in conformity with each other, and also with phenomena, and dogma
means an assent to anything that is unknown, then we reply that we
have no sect. If, however, one means by <span class=
"pagenum">17</span> sect, a school which follows a certain line of
reasoning based on phenomena, and that reasoning shows how it is
possible to apparently live rightly, not understanding "rightly" as
referring to virtue only, but in a broader sense; if, also, it
leads one to be able to suspend the judgment, then we reply that we
have a sect. For we follow a certain kind of reasoning which is
based upon phenomena, and which shows us how to live according to
the habits, laws, and teachings of the fatherland, and our own
feelings.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Does the Sceptic Study Natural
Science?</i></div>

<p>We reply similarly also to the question whether the <span class=
"pagenum">18</span> Sceptic should study natural science. For we do
not study natural science in order to express ourselves with
confidence regarding any of the dogmas that it teaches, but we take
it up in order to be able to meet every argument by one of equal
weight, and also for the sake of
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha;. In the same way
we study the logical and ethical part of so-called philosophy.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Do the Sceptics deny Phenomena?</i></div>

<p>Those who say that the Sceptics deny phenomena <span class=
"pagenum">19</span> appear to me to be in ignorance of our
teachings. For as we said before, we do not deny the sensations
which we think we have, and which lead us to assent involuntarily
to them, and these are the phenomena. When, however, we ask whether
the object is such as it appears to be, while we concede that it
appears so and so, we question, not the phenomenon, but in regard
to that which is asserted of the phenomenon, and that is different
from doubting the phenomenon itself. For example, it appears to us
that honey is sweet. This we concede, for we experience <span
class="pagenum">20</span> sweetness through sensation. We doubt,
however, whether it is sweet by reason of its essence, which is not
a question of the phenomenon, but of that which is asserted of the
phenomenon. Should we, however, argue directly against the
phenomena, it is not with the intention of denying their existence,
but to show the rashness of the Dogmatics. For if reasoning is such
a deceiver that it well nigh snatches away the phenomena from
before your eyes, how should we not distrust it in regard to things
that are unknown, so as not to rashly follow it?</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Criterion of Scepticism.</i></div>

<p>It is evident that we pay careful attention to phenomena <span
class="pagenum">21</span> from what we say about the criterion of
the Sceptical School. The word criterion is used in two ways.
First, it is understood as a proof of existence or non-existence,
in regard to which we shall speak in the opposing argument.
Secondly, when it refers to action, meaning the criterion to which
we give heed in life, in doing some things and refraining from
doing others, and it is about this that we shall now speak. We say,
consequently, that the criterion of the Sceptical School is the
phenomenon, and in calling <span class="pagenum">22</span> it so,
we mean the idea of it. It cannot be doubted, as it is based upon
susceptibility and involuntary feeling. Hence no one doubts,
perhaps, that an object appears so and so, but one questions if it
is as it appears. Therefore, as we cannot be entirely inactive as
regards the observances of daily life, we live by giving heed to
phenomena, and in an unprejudiced way. But this observance of what
pertains <span class="pagenum">23</span> to the daily life, appears
to be of four different kinds. Sometimes it is directed by the
guidance of nature, sometimes by the necessity of the feelings,
sometimes by the tradition of laws and of customs, and sometimes by
the teaching of the arts. It is directed by the guidance of <span
class="pagenum">24</span> nature, for by nature we are capable of
sensation and thought; by the necessity of the feelings, for hunger
leads us to food, and thirst to drink; by the traditions of laws
and customs, for according to them we consider piety a good in
daily life, and impiety an evil; by the teaching of the arts, for
we are not inactive in the arts we undertake. We say all these
things, however, without expressing a decided opinion.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>What is the aim of Scepticism?</i></div>

<p>It follows naturally in order to treat of the aim of the <span
class="pagenum">25</span> Sceptical School. An aim is that for
which as an end all things are done or thought, itself depending on
nothing, or in other words, it is the ultimatum of things to be
desired. We say, then, that the aim of the Sceptic is
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; in those things
which pertain to the opinion, and moderation in the things that
life imposes. For as soon as he began <span class=
"pagenum">26</span> to philosophise he wished to discriminate
between ideas, and to understand which are true and which are
false, in order to attain
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha;. He met, however,
with contradictions of equal weight, and, being unable to judge, he
withheld his opinion; and while his judgment was in suspension
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; followed, as if by
chance, in regard to matters of opinion. For he who is of the
opinion that <span class="pagenum">27</span> anything is either
good or bad by nature is always troubled, and when he does not
possess those things that seem to him good he thinks that he is
tortured by the things which are by nature bad, and pursues those
that he thinks to be good. Having acquired them, however, he falls
into greater perturbation, because he is excited beyond reason and
without measure from fear of a change, and he does everything in
his power to retain the things that seem to him good. But he who is
undecided, on the contrary, <span class="pagenum">28</span>
regarding things that are good and bad by nature, neither seeks nor
avoids anything eagerly, and is therefore in a state of
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha;. For that which is
related of Apelles the painter happened to the Sceptic. It is said
that as he was once painting a horse he wished to represent the
foam of his mouth in the picture, but he could not succeed in doing
so, and he gave it up and threw the sponge at the picture with
which he had wiped the colors from the painting. As soon, however,
as it touched the picture it produced a good copy of the foam. The
Sceptics likewise <span class="pagenum">29</span> hoped to gain
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; by forming
judgments in regard to the anomaly between phenomena and the things
of thought, but they were unable to do this, and so they suspended
their judgment; and while their judgment was in suspension
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; followed, as if by
chance, as the shadow follows a body. Nevertheless, we do not
consider the Sceptic wholly undisturbed, but he is disturbed by
some things that are inevitable. We confess that sometimes he is
cold and thirsty, and that he suffers in such ways. But in these
things even the ignorant are beset in <span class=
"pagenum">30</span> two ways, from the feelings themselves, and not
less also from the fact that they think these conditions are bad by
nature. The Sceptic, however, escapes more easily, as he rejects
the opinion that anything is in itself bad by nature. Therefore we
say that the aim of the Sceptic is
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; in matters of
opinion, and moderation of feeling in those things that are
inevitable. Some notable Sceptics have added also suspension of
judgment in investigation.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The General Method of Scepticism.</i></div>

<p>Since we have said that
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; follows the
suspension <span class="pagenum">31</span> of judgment in regard to
everything, it behooves us to explain how the suspension of
judgment takes place. Speaking in general it takes place through
placing things in opposition to each other. We either place
phenomena in opposition to phenomena, or the intellectual in
opposition to the intellectual, or reciprocally. For example, we
<span class="pagenum">32</span> place phenomena in opposition to
phenomena when we say that this tower appears round from a distance
but square near by; the intellectual in opposition to the
intellectual, when to the one who from the order of the heavens
builds a tower of reasoning to prove that a providence exists, we
oppose the fact that adversity often falls to the good and
prosperity to the evil, and that therefore we draw the conclusion
that there is no providence. The intellectual is <span class=
"pagenum">33</span> placed in opposition to phenomena, as when
Anaxagoras opposed the fact that snow is white, by saying that snow
is frozen water, and, as water is black, snow must also be black.
Likewise we sometimes place the present in opposition to the
present, similarly to the above-mentioned cases, and sometimes also
the present in opposition to the past or the future. As for
example, when someone proposes an argument to us that we cannot
refute, we say to him, "Before the founder of the sect to which you
belong <span class="pagenum">34</span> was born, the argument which
you propose in accordance with it had not appeared as a valid
argument, but was dormant in nature, so in the same way it is
possible that its refutation also exists in nature, but has not yet
appeared to us, so that it is not at all necessary for us to agree
with an argument that now seems to be strong." In <span class=
"pagenum">35</span> order to make it clearer to us what we mean by
these oppositions, I will proceed to give the Tropes
(&tau;&rho;&#972;&pi;&omicron;&iota;), through which the suspension
of judgment is produced, without asserting anything about their
meaning or their number, because they may be unsound, or there may
be more than I shall enumerate.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Ten Tropes.</i></div>

<p>Certain Tropes were commonly handed down by the <span class=
"pagenum">36</span> older Sceptics, by means of which
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; seems to take place. They are ten
in number, and are called synonymously
&lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&iota; and
&tau;&rho;&#972;&pi;&omicron;&iota;. They are these: The first is
based upon the differences in animals; the second upon the
differences in men; the third upon the difference in the
constitution of the organs of sense; the fourth upon circumstances;
the fifth upon position, distance, and place; the sixth upon
mixtures; the seventh upon the quantity and constitution of
objects; the eighth upon relation; the <span class=
"pagenum">37</span> ninth upon frequency or rarity of occurences;
the tenth upon systems, customs, laws, mythical beliefs, and
dogmatic opinions. We make this order ourselves. These <span class=
"pagenum">38</span> Tropes come under three general heads: the
standpoint of the judge, the standpoint of the thing judged, and
the standpoint of both together. Under the standpoint of the judge
come the first four, for the judge is either an animal, or a man,
or a sense, and exists under certain circumstances. Under the
standpoint of that which is judged, come the seventh and the tenth.
Under the one composed of both together, come the fifth and the
sixth, the eighth and the ninth. Again, these three divisions are
included under the Trope <span class="pagenum">39</span> of
relation, because that is the most general one; it includes the
three special divisions, and these in turn include the ten. We say
these things in regard to their probable number, and we proceed in
the following chapter to speak of their meaning.</p>

<h4>THE FIRST TROPE.</h4>

<p>The first Trope, we said, is the one based upon the <span class=
"pagenum">40</span> differences in animals, and according to this
Trope, different animals do not get the same ideas of the same
objects through the senses. This we conclude from the different
origin of the animals, and also from the difference in the
constitution of their bodies. In regard to the difference in
origin, some animals originate without mixture of the sexes, while
others originate through sexual intercourse. Of <span class=
"pagenum">41</span> those which originate without intercourse of
the sexes, some come from fire, as the little animals which appear
in the chimneys, others from stagnant water, as musquitoes, others
from fermented wine, as the stinging ants, others from the earth,
others from the mud, like the frogs, others from slime, as the
worms, others from donkeys, as the beetles, others from cabbage, as
caterpillars, others from fruit, as the gall insect from the wild
figs, others from putrified animals, as bees from bulls, and wasps
from horses. Again, of those originating from intercourse of <span
class="pagenum">42</span> the sexes, some come from animals of the
same kind, as in most cases, and others from those of different
kinds, as mules. Again, of animals in general, some are born alive,
as men, others from eggs, as birds, and others are born a lump of
flesh, as bears. It is probable therefore, that the <span class=
"pagenum">43</span> inequalities and differences in origin cause
great antipathies in the animals, and the result is
incompatibility, discord, and conflict between the sensations of
the different animals. Again, the differences in the principal
parts of the body, <span class="pagenum">44</span> especially in
those fitted by nature to judge and to perceive, may cause the
greatest differences in their ideas of objects, according to the
differences in the animals themselves. As for example, those who
have the jaundice call that yellow which appears to us white, and
those who have bloodshot eyes call it blood-red. Accordingly, as
some animals have yellow eyes, and others blood-shot ones, and
still others whitish ones, and others eyes of other colors, it is
probable, I think, that they have a different perception of colors.
Furthermore, when we look steadily <span class="pagenum">45</span>
at the sun for a long time, and then look down at a book, the
letters seem to us gold colored, and dance around. Now some animals
have by nature a lustre in their eyes, and these emit a fine and
sparkling light so that they see at night, and we may reasonably
suppose that external things do not appear the same to them as to
us. Jugglers by <span class="pagenum">46</span> lightly rubbing the
wick of the lamp with metal rust, or with the dark yellow fluid of
the sepia, make those who are present appear now copper-colored and
now black, according to the amount of the mixture used; if this be
so it is much more reasonable to suppose that because of the
mixture of different fluids in the eyes of animals, their ideas of
objects would be different. Furthermore, when <span class=
"pagenum">47</span> we press the eye on the side, the figures,
forms and sizes of things seen appear elongated and narrow. It is
therefore probable that such animals as have the pupil oblique and
long, as goats, cats, and similar animals, have ideas different
from those of the animals which have a round pupil. Mirrors
according to their different construction, sometimes <span class=
"pagenum">48</span> show the external object smaller than reality,
as concave ones, and sometimes long and narrow, as the convex ones
do; others show the head of the one looking into it down, and the
feet up. As some of the vessels around the eye <span class=
"pagenum">49</span> fall entirely outside the eye, on account of
their protuberance, while others are more sunken, and still others
are placed in an even surface, it is probable that for this reason
also the ideas vary, and dogs, fishes, lions, men, and grasshoppers
do not see the same things, either of the same size, or of similar
form, but according to the impression on the organ of sight of each
animal respectively. The same thing is true in regard to the other
senses; <span class="pagenum">50</span> for how can it be said that
shell-fish, birds of prey, animals covered with spines, those with
feathers and those with scales would be affected in the same way by
the sense of touch? and how can the sense of hearing perceive alike
in animals which have the narrowest auditory passages, and in those
that are furnished with the widest, or in those with hairy ears and
those with smooth ones? For we, even, hear differently when we
partially stop up the ears, from what we do when we use them
naturally. The sense of smell <span class="pagenum">51</span> also
varies according to differences in animals, since even our sense of
smell is affected when we have taken cold and the phlegm is too
abundant, and also when parts around our head are flooded with too
much blood, for we then avoid odors that seem agreeable to others,
and feel as if we were injured by them. Since also some of the
animals are moist by nature and full of secretions, and others are
very full of blood, and still others have either yellow or black
bile prevalent and abundant, it is reasonable because of this to
think that odorous things appear different to each one of them. And
it is the same in <span class="pagenum">52</span> regard to things
of taste, as some animals have the tongue rough and dry and others
very moist. We too, when we have a dry tongue in fever, think that
whatever we take is gritty, bad tasting, or bitter; and this we
experience because of the varying degrees of the humors that are
said to be in us. Since, then, different animals have different
organs for taste, and a greater or less amount of the various
humors, it can well be that they form different ideas of the same
objects as regards their taste. For just as the same <span class=
"pagenum">536</span> food on being absorbed becomes in some places
veins, in other places arteries, and in other places bones, nerves,
or other tissues, showing different power according to the
difference of the parts receiving it; just as the same water
absorbed by the trees becomes in some places bark, in other places
branches, and in other places fruit, perhaps a fig or a
pomegranate, or something else; just as the breath of <span class=
"pagenum">54</span> the musician, one and the same when blown into
the flute, becomes sometimes a high tone and sometimes a low one,
and the same pressure of the hand upon the lyre sometimes causes a
deep tone and sometimes a high tone, so it is natural to suppose
that external objects are regarded differently according to the
different constitution of the animals which perceive them. We may
see this more <span class="pagenum">55</span> clearly in the things
that are sought for and avoided by animals. For example, myrrh
appears very agreeable to men and intolerable to beetles and bees.
Oil also, which is useful to men, destroys wasps and bees if
sprinkled on them; and sea-water, while it is unpleasant and
poisonous to men if they drink it, is most agreeable and sweet to
fishes. Swine also prefer to wash in vile filth rather than <span
class="pagenum">56</span> in pure clean water. Furthermore, some
animals eat grass and some eat herbs; some live in the woods,
others eat seeds; some are carnivorous, and others lactivorous;
some enjoy putrified food, and others fresh food; some raw food and
others that which is prepared by cooking; and in general that which
is agreeable to some is disagreeable and fatal to others, and
should be avoided by them. Thus <span class="pagenum">57</span>
hemlock makes the quail fat, and henbane the hogs, and these, as it
is known, enjoy eating lizards; deer also eat poisonous animals,
and swallows, the cantharidae. Moreover, ants and flying ants, when
swallowed by men, cause discomfort and colic; but the bear, on the
contrary, whatever sickness he may have, becomes stronger by
devouring them. The viper is benumbed if one twig of the oak <span
class="pagenum">58</span> touches it, as is also the bat by a leaf
of the plane-tree. The elephant flees before the ram, and the lion
before the cock, and seals from the rattling of beans that are
being pounded, and the tiger from the sound of the drum. Many other
examples could be given, but that we may not seem to dwell longer
than is necessary on this subject, we conclude by saying that since
the same things are pleasant to some and unpleasant to others, and
the pleasure and displeasure depend on the ideas, it must be that
different animals have different ideas of objects. And since the
<span class="pagenum">59</span> same things appear different
according to the difference in the animals, it will be possible for
us to say how the external object appears to us, but as to how it
is in reality we shall suspend our judgment. For we cannot
ourselves judge between our own ideas and those of other animals,
being ourselves involved in the difference, and therefore much more
in need of being judged than being ourselves able to judge. And
furthermore, we cannot give the <span class="pagenum">60</span>
preference to our own mental representations over those of other
animals, either without evidence or with evidence, for besides the
fact that perhaps there is no evidence, as we shall show, the
evidence so called will be either manifest to us or not. If it is
not manifest to us, then we cannot accept it with conviction; if it
is manifest to us, since the question is in regard to what is
manifest to animals, and we use as evidence that which is manifest
to us who are animals, then it is to be questioned if it is true as
it is manifest to us. It is absurd, however, to try to <span class=
"pagenum">61</span> base the questionable on the questionable,
because the same thing is to be believed and not to be believed,
which is certainly impossible. The evidence is to be believed in so
far as it will furnish a proof, and disbelieved in so far as it is
itself to be proved. We shall therefore have no evidence according
to which we can give preference to our own ideas over those of
so-called irrational animals. Since therefore ideas differ
according to the difference in animals, and it is impossible to
judge them, it is necessary to suspend the judgment in regard to
external objects.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Have the So-called Irrational Animals
Reason</i>?</div>

<p>We continue the comparison of the so-called irrational <span
class="pagenum">62</span> animals with man, although it is needless
to do so, for in truth we do not refuse to hold up to ridicule the
conceited and bragging Dogmatics, after having given the practical
arguments. Now most of our number were accustomed to compare all
the irrational animals together with man, but because the Dogmatics
playing upon words say that the <span class="pagenum">63</span>
comparison is unequal, we carry our ridicule farther, although it
is most superfluous to do so, and fix the discussion on one animal,
as the dog, if it suits you, which seems to be the most
contemptible animal; for we shall even then find that animals,
about which we are speaking, are not inferior to us in respect to
the trustworthiness of their perceptions. Now the Dogmatics grant
that this <span class="pagenum">64</span> animal is superior to us
in sense perception, for he perceives better through smell than we,
as by this sense he tracks wild animals that he cannot see, and he
sees them quicker with his eyes than we do, and he perceives them
more acutely by hearing. Let us also consider reasoning, which is
of two <span class="pagenum">65</span> kinds, reasoning in thought
and in speech. Let us look first to that of thought. This kind of
reasoning, judging from the teachings of those Dogmatics who are
now our greatest opponents, those of the Stoa, seems to fluctuate
between the following things: the choice of the familiar, and
avoidance of the alien; the knowledge of the arts that lead to this
choice; and the comprehension of those virtues that belong to the
individual nature, as regards the feelings. The dog then, upon whom
it was decided to fix the argument <span class="pagenum">66</span>
as an example, makes a choice of things suitable to him, and avoids
those that are harmful, for he hunts for food, but draws back when
the whip is lifted up; he possesses also an art by which he
procures the things that are suitable for him, the art of hunting.
He is not also <span class="pagenum">67</span> without virtue;
since the true nature of justice is to give to every one according
to his merit, as the dog wags his tail to those who belong to the
family, and to those who behave well to him, guards them, and keeps
off strangers and evil doers, he is surely not without justice. Now
if he <span class="pagenum">68</span> has this virtue, since the
virtues follow each other in turn, he has the other virtues also,
which the wise men say, most men do not possess. We see the dog
also brave in warding off attacks, and sagacious, as Homer
testified when he represented Odysseus as unrecognised by all in
his house, and recognised only by Argos, because the dog was not
deceived by the physical change in the man, and had not lost the
&phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&#943;&alpha;
&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&lambda;&eta;&pi;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#942;
which he proved that he had kept better than the men had. But
according to <span class="pagenum">69</span> Chrysippus even, who
most attacked the irrational animals, the dog takes a part in the
dialectic about which so much is said. At any rate, the man above
referred to said that the dog follows the fifth of the several
non-apodictic syllogisms, for when he comes to a meeting of three
roads, after seeking the scent in the two roads, through which his
prey has not passed, he presses forward quickly in the third
without scenting it. For the dog reasons in this way, potentially
said the man of olden time; the animal passed through this, or
this, or this; it was neither through this nor this, therefore it
was through this. The dog also understands <span class=
"pagenum">70</span> his own sufferings and mitigates them. As soon
as a sharp stick is thrust into him, he sets out to remove it, by
rubbing his foot on the ground, as also with his teeth; and if ever
he has a wound anywhere, for the reason that uncleansed wounds are
difficult to cure, and those that are cleansed are easily cured, he
gently wipes off the collected matter; and <span class=
"pagenum">71</span> he observes the Hippocratic advice exceedingly
well, for since quiet is a relief for the foot, if he has ever a
wound in the foot, he lifts it up, and keeps it undisturbed as much
as possible. When he is troubled by disturbing humours, he eats
grass, with which he vomits up that which was unfitting, and
recovers. Since therefore it has been shown <span class=
"pagenum">72</span> that the animal that we fixed the argument upon
for the sake of an example, chooses that which is suitable for him,
and avoids what is harmful, and that he has an art by which he
provides what is suitable, and that he comprehends his own
sufferings and mitigates them, and that he is not without virtue,
things in which perfection of reasoning in thought consists, so
according to this it would seem that the dog has reached
perfection. It is for this reason, it appears to me, that some
philosophers have honoured themselves with the name of this animal.
In regard to reasoning <span class="pagenum">73</span> in speech,
it is not necessary at present to bring the matter in question. For
some of the Dogmatics, even, have put this aside, as opposing the
acquisition of virtue, for which reason they practiced silence when
studying. Besides, let it be supposed that a man is dumb, no one
would say that he is consequently irrational. However, aside from
this, we see after all, that animals, about which we are speaking,
do produce human sounds, as the jay and some others. Aside from
this also, even if we do not <span class="pagenum">74</span>
understand the sounds of the so-called irrational animals, it is
not at all unlikely that they converse, and that we do not
understand their conversation. For when we hear the language of
foreigners, we do not understand but it all seems like one sound to
us. Furthermore, we hear dogs <span class="pagenum">75</span>
giving out one kind of sound when they are resisting someone, and
another sound when they howl, and another when they are beaten, and
a different kind when they wag their tails, and generally speaking,
if one examines into this, he will find a great difference in the
sounds of this and other animals under different circumstances; so
that in all likelihood, it may be said that the so-called
irrational animals partake also in spoken language. If then, they
are not <span class="pagenum">76</span> inferior to men in the
accuracy of their perceptions, nor in reasoning in thought, nor in
reasoning by speech, as it is superfluous to say, then they are not
more untrustworthy than we are, it seems to me, in regard to their
ideas. Perhaps it would be possible to prove this, should we direct
<span class="pagenum">77</span> the argument to each of the
irrational animals in turn. As for example, who would not say that
the birds are distinguished for shrewdness, and make use of
articulate speech? for they not only know the present but the
future, and this they augur to those that are able to understand
it, audibly as well as in other ways. I have made this comparison
<span class="pagenum">78</span> superfluously, as I pointed out
above, as I think I had sufficiently shown before, that we cannot
consider our own ideas superior to those of the irrational animals.
In short, if the irrational animals are not more untrustworthy than
we in regard to the judgment of their ideas, and the ideas are
different according to the difference in the animals, I shall be
able to say how each object appears to me, but in regard to what it
is by nature I shall be obliged to suspend my judgment.</p>

<h4>THE SECOND TROPE.</h4>

<p>Such is the first Trope of &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;. The
second, we said <span class="pagenum">79</span> above, is based
upon the differences in men. For even if one assent to the
hypothesis that men are more trustworthy than the irrational
animals, we shall find that doubt arises as soon as we consider our
own differences. For since man is said to be composed of two
things, soul and body, we differ from each other in respect to both
of these things; for example, as regards the body, we differ both
in form and personal peculiarities. For the body of a Scythian
<span class="pagenum">80</span> differs from the body of an Indian
in form, the difference resulting, it is said, from the different
control of the humors. According to different control of the
humors, differences in ideas arise also, as we represented under
the first Trope. For this reason there is certainly a great
difference among men in the choice and avoidance of external
things. The Indians delight in different things from our own
people, and the enjoyment of different things is a sign that
different ideas are received of the external objects. We differ in
personal peculiarities, as <span class="pagenum">81</span> some
digest beef better than the little fish from rocky places, and some
are affected with purging by the weak wine of Lesbos. There was,
they say, an old woman in Attica who could drink thirty drachmas of
hemlock without danger, and Lysis took four drachmas of opium
unhurt, and Demophon, Alexander's table waiter, shivered when <span
class="pagenum">82</span> he was in the sun or in a hot bath, and
felt warm in the shade; Athenagoras also, from Argos, did not
suffer harm if stung by scorpions and venomous spiders; the
so-called Psylli were not injured when bitten by snakes or by the
aspis, and the Tentyrites among the Egyptians are not harmed by the
crocodiles around them; those also of the <span class=
"pagenum">83</span> Ethiopians who live on the Hydaspes river,
opposite Meroe, eat scorpions and serpents, and similar things
without danger; Rufinus in Chalcis could drink hellebore without
vomiting or purging, and he enjoyed and digested it as something to
which he was accustomed; Chrysermos, the <span class=
"pagenum">84</span> Herophilian, ran the risk of stomach-ache if he
ever took pepper, and Soterichus, the surgeon, was seized by
purging if he perceived the odor of roasting shad; Andron, the
Argive, was so free from thirst that he could travel even through
the waterless Libya without looking for a drink; Tiberius, the
emperor, saw in the dark, and Aristotle tells the story of a
certain Thracian, who thought that he saw the figure of a man
always going before him as a guide. While therefore such a
difference exists in men in regard <span class="pagenum">85</span>
to the body, and we must be satisfied with referring to a few only
of the many examples given by the Dogmatics, it is probable that
men also differ from each other in respect to the soul itself, for
the body is a kind of type of the soul, as the physiognomical craft
also shows. The best example of the numerous and infinite
differences of opinion among men is the contradiction in the
sayings of the Dogmatics, not only about other things, but about
what it is well to seek and to avoid. The poets have also fittingly
spoken <span class="pagenum">86</span> about this, for Pindar
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="quote">"One delights in getting honors and crowns
through storm-footed horses,</div>

<div class="i0">Another in passing life in rooms rich in
gold,</div>

<div class="i0">Another still, safe travelling enjoys, in a swift
ship, on a wave of the sea."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the poet says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="quote">"One man enjoys this, another enjoys
that."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The tragedies also abound in such expressions, for instance, it
is said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="quote">"If to all, the same were good and wise,</div>

<div class="i0">Quarrels and disputes among men would not have
been."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And again&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"It is awful indeed, that the same thing some
mortals should please,</div>

<div class="i0">And by others be hated."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Since therefore the choice and the avoidance of things, <span
class="pagenum">87</span> depends on the pleasure and displeasure
which they give, and the pleasure and displeasure have their seat
in perception and ideas, when some choose the things that others
avoid, it is logical for us to conclude that they are not acted
upon similarly by the same things, for otherwise they would have
chosen or avoided alike. Now if the same things act upon different
men differently, on account of the difference in the men, for this
cause also suspension of the judgment may reasonably be introduced,
and we may perhaps say how each object appears to us, and what its
individual differences are, but we shall not be able to declare
what it is as to the nature of its essence. For we must either
<span class="pagenum">88</span> believe all men or some men; but to
believe all is to undertake an impossibility, and to accept things
that are in opposition to each other. If we believe some only, let
someone tell us with whom to agree, for the Platonist would say
with Plato, the Epicurean with Epicurus, and others would advise in
a corresponding manner; and so as they disagree, with no one to
decide, they bring us round again to the suspension of judgment.
Furthermore, he <span class="pagenum">89</span> who tells us to
agree with the majority proposes something childish, as no one
could go to all men and find out what pleases the majority, for it
is possible that in some nations which we do not know the things
which to us are rare are common to the majority, and those things
which happen commonly to us are rare. As for example, it might
happen that the majority should not suffer when bitten by venomous
spiders, or that they should seldom feel pain, or have other
personal peculiarities similar to those spoken of above. It is
necessary therefore to suspend the judgment on account of the
differences in men.</p>

<h4>THE THIRD TROPE.</h4>

<p>While, however, the Dogmatics are conceited enough <span class=
"pagenum">90</span> to think that they should be preferred to other
men in the judgement of things, we know that their claim is absurd,
for they themselves form a part of the disagreement; and if they
give themselves preference in this way in the judgment of
phenomena, they beg the question before they begin the judgment, as
they trust the judgment to themselves. Nevertheless, in order that
we should reach the <span class="pagenum">91</span> result of the
suspension of judgment by limiting the argument to one man, one who
for example they deem to be wise, let us take up the third Trope.
This is the one that is based upon differences in perception. That
the <span class="pagenum">92</span> perceptions differ from each
other is evident. For example, paintings seem to have hollows and
prominences to the sense of sight, but not to the sense of touch,
and honey to the tongue of some people appears pleasant, but
unpleasant to the eyes; therefore it is impossible to say whether
it is really pleasant or unpleasant. In regard to myrrh it is the
same, for it delights the sense of smell, but disgusts the sense of
taste. Also in regard to euphorbium, <span class=
"pagenum">93</span> since it is harmful to the eyes and harmless to
all the rest of the body, we are not able to say whether it is
really harmless to bodies or not, as far as its own nature is
concerned. Rain-water, too, is useful to the eyes, but it makes the
trachea and the lungs rough, just as oil does, although it soothes
the skin; and the sea-torpedo placed on the extremities makes them
numb, but is harmless when placed on the rest of the body.
Wherefore we cannot say what each of these things is by nature. It
is possible only to say how it appears each time. We could cite
<span class="pagenum">94</span> more examples than these, but in
order not to spend too long in laying out the plan of this book we
shall simply say the following: Each of the phenomena perceived by
us seems to present itself in many forms, as the apple, smooth,
fragrant, sweet, yellow. Now it is not known whether it has in
reality only those qualities which appear to us, or if it has only
one quality, but appears different on account of the different
constitution of the sense organs, or if it has more qualities than
appear to us, but some of them do not affect us. That it has only
one quality might be concluded <span class="pagenum">95</span> from
what we have said about the food distributed in bodies, and the
water distributed in trees, and the breath in the flute and syrinx,
and in similar instruments; for it is possible that the apple also
has only one quality, but appears different on account of the
difference in the sense organs by which it is perceived. On the
other hand, that <span class="pagenum">96</span> the apple has more
qualities than those that appear to us, can be argued in this way:
Let us imagine someone born with the sense of touch, of smell, and
of taste, but neither hearing nor seeing. He will then assume that
neither anything visible nor anything audible exists at all, but
only the three kinds of qualities which he can apprehend. It is
<span class="pagenum">97</span> possible then that as we have only
the five senses, we apprehend only those qualities of the apple
which we are able to grasp, but it may be supposed that other
qualities exist which would affect other sense organs if we
possessed them; as it is, we do not feel the sensations which would
be felt through them. But nature, one will say, has <span class=
"pagenum">98</span> brought the senses into harmony with the
objects to be perceived. What kind of nature? Among the Dogmatics a
great difference of opinion reigns about the real existence of
nature anyway; for he who decides whether there is a nature or not,
if he is an uneducated man, would be according to them
untrustworthy; if he is a philosopher, he is a part of the
disagreement, and is himself to be judged, but is not a judge. In
short, if it is possible that <span class="pagenum">99</span> only
those qualities exist in the apple which we seem to perceive, or
that more than these are there, or that not even those which we
perceive exist, it will be unknown to us what kind of a thing the
apple is. The same argument holds for other objects of perception.
If, however, the senses do not comprehend the external world, the
intellect cannot comprehend it either, so that for this reason also
it will appear that the suspension of judgment follows in regard to
external objects.</p>

<h4>THE FOURTH TROPE.</h4>

<p>In order to attain to &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; by fixing
the argument on <span class="pagenum">100</span> each separate
sense, or even by putting aside the senses altogether, we take up
the fourth Trope of &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;. This is the
one based upon circumstances, and by circumstances we mean
conditions. This Trope comes under consideration, we may say, with
regard to conditions that are according to nature, or contrary to
nature; such as waking or sleeping, the age of life, moving or
keeping still, hating or loving, need or satiety, drunkenness or
sobriety, predispositions, being courageous or afraid, sorrowing or
rejoicing. For <span class="pagenum">101</span> example, things
appear different as they are according to nature, or contrary to
it; as for instance, the insane and those inspired by a god, think
that they hear gods, while we do not; in like manner they often say
that they perceive the odor of storax or frankincense, or the like,
and many other things which we do not perceive. Water, also, that
seems lukewarm to us, if poured over places that are inflamed, will
feel hot, and a garment that appears orange-coloured to those that
have blood-shot eyes, would not look so to me, and the same honey
appears sweet to me, but bitter to those who have the jaundice. If
one should say <span class="pagenum">102</span> that those who are
not in a natural state have unusual ideas of objects, because of
the intermingling of certain humors, then one must also say, that
it may be that objects which are really what they seem to be to
those who are in an unnatural condition, appear different to those
who are in health, for even those who are in health have humors
that are mixed with each other. For to give to one kind of <span
class="pagenum">103</span> fluid a power to change objects, and not
to another kind, is a fiction of the mind; for just as those who
are in health are in a condition that is natural to those who are
in health, and contrary to the nature of those who are not in
health, so also those who are not in health, are in a condition
contrary to the nature of those in health, but natural to those not
in health, and we must therefore believe that they also are in some
respect in a natural condition. Furthermore, <span class=
"pagenum">104</span> in sleep or in waking, the ideas are
different, because we do not see things in the same way when we are
awake as we do in sleep; neither do we see them in the same way in
sleep as we do when awake, so that the existence or non-existence
of these things is not absolute, but relative, that is in relation
to a sleeping or waking condition. It is therefore probable that we
see those things in sleep which in a waking condition do not exist,
but they are not altogether non-existent, for they exist in sleep,
just as those things which exist when we are awake, exist, although
they do not exist in sleep. Furthermore, things present themselves
<span class="pagenum">105</span> differently according to the age
of life, for the same air seems cold to the aged, but temperate to
those in their prime, and the same color appears dim to those who
are old, and bright to those in their prime, and likewise the same
tone seems faint to the former, and audible to the latter. People
in different ages are also differently disposed <span class=
"pagenum">106</span> towards things to be chosen or avoided;
children, for example, are very fond of balls and hoops, while
those in their prime prefer other things, and the old still others,
from which it follows that the ideas in regard to the same objects
differ in different periods of life. Furthermore, <span class=
"pagenum">107</span> things appear different in a condition of
motion and rest, since that which we see at rest when we are still,
seems to move when we are sailing by it. There are also differences
<span class="pagenum">108</span> which depend on liking or
disliking, as some detest swine flesh exceedingly, but others eat
it with pleasure. As Menander said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="quote">"O how his face appears</div>

<div class="i0">Since he became such a man! What a creature!</div>

<div class="i0">Doing no injustice would make us also
beautiful."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many also that love ugly women consider them very beautiful
Furthermore, there are differences which depend on <span class=
"pagenum">109</span> hunger or satiety, as the same food seems
agreeable to those who are hungry, and disagreeable to those who
are satisfied. There are also differences depending on drunkenness
and sobriety, as that which we consider ugly when we are sober does
not appear ugly to us when we are drunk. Again, <span class=
"pagenum">110</span> there are differences depending on
predispositions, as the same wine appears sourish to those who have
previously eaten dates or dried figs, but agreeable to those who
have taken nuts or chickpeas; the vestibule of the bath warms those
who enter from without, but cools those who go out, if they rest in
it. Furthermore, there are differences depending <span class=
"pagenum">111</span> on being afraid or courageous, as the same
thing seems fearful and terrible to the coward, but in no wise so
to him who is brave. There are differences, also, depending on
being sad or joyful, as the same things are unpleasant to the sad,
but pleasant to the joyful. Since therefore <span class=
"pagenum">112</span> the anomalies depending on conditions are so
great, and since men are in different conditions at different
times, it is perhaps easy to say how each object appears to each
man, but not so of what kind it is, because the anomaly is not of a
kind to be judged. For he who would pass judgment upon this is
either in some one of the conditions mentioned above, or is in
absolutely no condition whatever; but to say that he is in no
condition at all, as, for example, that he is neither in health nor
in illness, that he is neither moving nor quiet, that he is not of
any age, and also that he is free from the other conditions, is
wholly absurd. But <span class="pagenum">113</span> if he judges
the ideas while he is in any condition whatever, he is a part of
the contradiction, and, besides, he is no genuine critic of
external objects, because he is confused by the condition in which
he finds himself. Therefore neither can the one who is awake
compare the ideas of those who are asleep with those who are awake,
nor can he who is in health compare the ideas of the sick with
those of the well; for we believe more in the things that are
present, and affecting us at present, than in the things not
present. In another way, the anomaly in such ideas <span class=
"pagenum">114</span> is impossible to be judged, for whoever
prefers one idea to another, and one condition to another, does
this either without a criterion and a proof, or with a criterion
and a proof; but he can do this neither without them, for he would
then be untrustworthy, nor with them; for if he judges ideas, he
judges them wholly by a criterion, and he will say that this
criterion is either true or false. But if it <span class=
"pagenum">115</span> is false, he will be untrustworthy; if, on the
contrary, he says that it is true, he will say that the criterion
is true either without proof or with proof. If without proof, he
will be untrustworthy; if he says that it is true with proof, it is
certainly necessary that the proof be true, or he will be
untrustworthy. Now will he say that the proof which he has accepted
for the accrediting of the criterion is true, having judged it, or
without having judged it? If he says <span class=
"pagenum">116</span> so without judging it, he will be
untrustworthy; if he has judged it, it is evident that he will say
that he has judged according to some criterion, and we must seek a
proof for this criterion, and for that proof a criterion. For the
proof always needs a criterion to establish it, and the criterion
needs a proof that it may be shown to be true; and a proof can
neither be sound without a pre-existing criterion that is true, nor
a criterion true without a proof that is shown beforehand to be
trustworthy. And so both the criterion <span class=
"pagenum">117</span> and the proof are thrown into the <i>circulus
in probando</i>, by which it is found that they are both of them
untrustworthy, for as each looks for proof from the other, each is
as untrustworthy as the other. Since then one cannot prefer one
idea to another, either without a proof and a criterion or with
them, the ideas that differ according to different conditions
cannot be judged, so that the suspension of judgment in regard to
the nature of external objects follows through this Trope also.</p>

<h4>THE FIFTH TROPE.</h4>

<p>The fifth Trope is that based upon position, distance, <span
class="pagenum">118</span> and place, for, according to each of
these, the same things appear different, as for example, the same
arcade seen from either end appears curtailed, but from the middle
it looks symmetrical on every side; and the same ship appears small
and motionless from afar, and large and in motion near by, and the
same tower appears round from a distance, but square near by. So
much for distance. Now in reference <span class=
"pagenum">119</span> to place, we say that the light of the lamp
appears dim in the sun, but bright in the dark; and the same rudder
appears broken in the sea, but straight out of it; and the egg in
the bird is soft, but in the air hard; and the lyngurion is a fluid
in the lynx, but is hard in the air; and the coral is soft in the
sea, but hard in the air; and a tone of voice appears different
produced by a syrinx, and by a flute, and different simply in the
air. Also in reference <span class="pagenum">120</span> to
position, the same picture leaned back appears smooth, and leaned
forward a little seems to have hollows and protuberances, and the
necks of doves appear different in color according to the
difference in inclination. Since <span class="pagenum">121</span>
then all phenomena are seen in relation to place, distance, and
position, each of which relation makes a great difference with the
idea, as we have mentioned, we shall be obliged by this Trope also
to come to the suspension of judgment. For he who wishes to give
preference to certain ones of these ideas will attempt the
impossible. For if he simply <span class="pagenum">122</span> makes
the decision without proof he will be untrustworthy. If, however,
he wishes to make use of a proof, should he say that the proof is
false, he contradicts himself, but if he declares the proof to be
true, proof of its proof will be demanded of him, and another proof
for that, which proof also must be true, and so on to the
<i>regressus in infinitum</i>. It is impossible, however, to
present proofs <i>in infinitum</i>, so <span class=
"pagenum">123</span> that one will not be able to prove that one
idea is to be preferred to another. Since then one cannot either
without proof or with proof judge the ideas in question, the
suspension of judgment results, and how each thing appears
according to this or that position, or this or that distance, or
this or that place, we perhaps are able to say, but what it really
is it is impossible to declare, for the reasons which we have
mentioned.</p>

<h4>THE SIXTH TROPE.</h4>

<p>The sixth Trope is the one based upon mixtures, according <span
class="pagenum">124</span> to which we conclude that since no
object presents itself alone, but always together with something
else, it is perhaps possible to say of what nature the mixture is,
of the thing itself, and of that with which it is seen, but of what
sort the external object really is we shall not be able to say. Now
it is evident, I think, that nothing from without is known to us by
itself, but always with something else, and that because of this
fact it appears different. The color of our skin, for example, is
different seen in <span class="pagenum">125</span> warm air from
what it is in cold, and we could not say what our color really is,
only what it is when viewed under each of these conditions. The
same sound appears different in rare air from what it is in dense,
and aromas are more overpowering in the warm bath and in the sun
than they are in the cold air, and a body surrounded by water is
light, but by air heavy. Leaving aside, however, <span class=
"pagenum">126</span> outer mixtures, our eyes have inside of them
coatings and humors. Since then visible things are not seen without
these, they will not be accurately comprehended, for it is the
mixture that we perceive, and for this reason those who have the
jaundice see everything yellow, and those with bloodshot eyes
bloody. Since the same sound appears different in broad open places
from what it does in narrow and winding ones, and different in pure
air and in impure, it is probable that we do not perceive the tones
unmixed; for the ears have narrow winding passages filled with
vaporous secretions, which it is said gather from places around the
head. Since also there are substances present <span class=
"pagenum">127</span> in the nostrils and in the seat of the sense
of taste, we perceive the things smelled and the things tasted in
connection with them, and not unmixed. So that because of mixture
the senses do not perceive accurately what the external objects
are. The intellect even does not do this, <span class=
"pagenum">128</span> chiefly because its guides, the senses, make
mistakes, and perhaps it itself adds a certain special mixture to
those messages communicated by the senses; for in each place where
the Dogmatics think that the ruling faculty is situated, we see
that certain humors are present, whether one would locate it in the
region of the brain, in the region of the heart, or somewhere else.
Since therefore according to this Trope also, we see that we cannot
say anything regarding the nature of external objects, we are
obliged to suspend our judgment.</p>

<h4>THE SEVENTH TROPE.</h4>

<p>The seventh Trope is the one which, as we said, is based <span
class="pagenum">129</span> upon the quantity and constitution of
objects, constitution commonly meaning composition. And it is
evident that we are obliged to suspend our judgment according to
this Trope also in regard to the nature of things. As for example,
filings from the horn of the goat appear white when they are seen
separately and without being put together; put together, however,
in the form of a horn, they look black. And the parts of silver,
the filings that is, by themselves appear black, but as a whole
appear white; and parts of the Taenarus stone look white when
ground, but in the whole stone appear yellow; grains of <span
class="pagenum">130</span> sand scattered apart from each other
appear to be rough, but put together in a heap, they produce a soft
feeling; hellebore taken fine and downy, causes choking, but it no
longer does so when taken coarse; wine also taken <span class=
"pagenum">131</span> moderately strengthens us, but when taken in
excess relaxes the body; food similarly, has a different effect
according to the quantity, at least, it often disturbs the body
when too much is taken, causing dyspepsia and discharge. We shall
<span class="pagenum">132</span> be able here also to say of what
kind the cutting from the horn is, and what many cuttings put
together are, of what kind a filing of silver is, and what many of
them put together are, of what kind the tiny Taenarus stone, and
what one composed of many small ones is, and in regard to the
grains of sand, and the hellebore, and the wine, and the food, what
they are in relation, but no longer the nature of the thing by
itself, because of the anomaly in the ideas which we have of
things, according to the way in which they are put together. In
general it appears that useful things <span class=
"pagenum">133</span> become harmful when an intemperate use is made
of them, and things that seem harmful when taken in excess, are not
injurious in a small quantity. What we see in the effect of
medicines witnesses especially to this fact, as an exact mixture of
simple remedies makes a compound which is helpful, but sometimes
when a very small inclination of the balance is overlooked, the
medicine is not only not helpful, but very harmful, and often
poisonous. So the <span class="pagenum">134</span> argument based
upon the quantity and constitution of objects, puts in confusion
the existence of external objects. Therefore this Trope naturally
leads us to suspend our judgment, as we are not able to declare
exactly the nature of external objects.</p>

<h4>THE EIGHTH TROPE.</h4>

<p>The eighth Trope is the one based upon relation, from <span
class="pagenum">135</span> which we conclude to suspend our
judgment as to what things are absolutely, in their nature, since
every thing is in relation to something else. And we must bear in
mind that we use the word <i>is</i> incorrectly, in place of
<i>appears</i>, meaning to say, every thing <i>appears</i> to be in
relation. This is said, however, with two meanings: first, that
every thing is in relation to the one who judges, for the external
object, <i>i.e.</i> the thing judged, appears to be in relation to
the judge; the other way is that every thing is in relation to the
things considered together with it, as the relation of the right
hand to the left. But we came to the conclusion <span class=
"pagenum">136</span> above, that every thing is in relation to
something, as for example, to the one judging; each thing appears
in relation to this or that animal, and this or that man, and this
or that sense, and in certain circumstances; as regards things
considered together, also, each thing appears in relation to this
or that mixture, and this or that Trope, and this or that
composition, quantity and place. And in another way <span class=
"pagenum">137</span> it is possible to conclude that every thing is
in relation to something, as follows: does the being in difference
differ from the being in relation, or not? If it does not differ,
then it is the same as relation; if it does differ, since every
thing which differs is in some relation, for it is said to be in
relation to that from which it differs, those things which are in a
difference are in a relation to something. Now <span class=
"pagenum">138</span> according to the Dogmatics, some beings belong
to the highest genera, others to the lowest species, and others to
both genera and species at the same time; all of these are in
relation to something, therefore every thing is in relation to
something. Furthermore, among things, some things are manifest, and
others are hidden, as the Dogmatics themselves say, and the things
that make themselves known to us are the phenomena, and the things
that are made known to us by the phenomena are the hidden things,
for according to the Dogmatics, the phenomena are the outward
appearance of the unknown; then that which makes known, and that
which is made known, are in relation to something; every thing,
therefore, is in relation to something. In <span class=
"pagenum">139</span> addition to this, some things are similar to
each other, and others are dissimilar, some are equal, and others
are unequal. Now these things are in relation to something,
therefore every thing is in relation to something, and whoever says
that every thing is not in relation to something, himself
establishes the fact that every thing is in relation to something,
for even in saying that every thing <span class=
"pagenum">140</span> is not in relation to something, he proves it
in reference to us, and not in general, by his objections to us. In
short, as we have shown that every thing is in relation to
something, it is then evident that we shall not be able to say
exactly what each object is by nature, but what it appears to be
like in relation to something else. It follows from this, that we
must suspend our judgment regarding the nature of things.</p>

<h4>THE NINTH TROPE.</h4>

<p>In regard to the Trope based on the frequency and <span class=
"pagenum">141</span> rarity of events, which we call the ninth of
the series, we give the following explanation: The sun is certainly
a much more astonishing thing than a comet, but because we see the
sun continually and the comet rarely we are so much astonished at
the comet that it even seems an omen, while we are not at all
astonished at the sun. If, however, we should imagine the sun
appearing at rare intervals, and at rare intervals setting, in the
first instance suddenly lighting up all things, and in the second
casting everything into shade, we should see great astonishment at
the sight. An earthquake, too, does not trouble those who
experience <span class="pagenum">142</span> it for the first time
in the same manner as those who have become accustomed to it. How
great the astonishment of a man who beholds the sea for the first
time! And the beauty of the human body, seen suddenly for the first
time, moves us more than if we are accustomed to seeing it. That
which is rare seems valuable, while things that <span class=
"pagenum">143</span> are familiar and easily obtained seem by no
means so. If, for example, we should imagine water as rare, of how
much greater value would it seem than all other valuable things! or
if we imagine gold as simply thrown about on the ground in large
quantities like stones, to whom do we think it would be valuable,
or by whom would it be hoarded, as it is now? Since then the same
things according to the frequency or rarity that they are met with
seem to be now valuable and now not so, we conclude that it may be
that we shall be able <span class="pagenum">144</span> to say what
kind of a thing each of them appears to be according to the
frequency or rarity with which it occurs, but we are not able to
say what each external object is absolutely. Therefore, according
to this Trope also, we suspend our judgment regarding these
things.</p>

<h4>THE TENTH TROPE.</h4>

<p>The tenth Trope is the one principally connected with <span
class="pagenum">145</span> morals, relating to schools, customs,
laws, mythical beliefs, and dogmatic opinions. Now a school is a
choice of a manner of life, or of something held by one or many, as
for example the school of Diogenes or the Laconians. A <span class=
"pagenum">146</span> law is a written contract among citizens, the
transgressor of which is punished. A custom or habit, for there is
no difference, is a common acceptance of a certain thing by many,
the deviator from which is in no wise punished. For example, it is
a law not to commit adultery, and it is a custom with us
&tau;&#8056; &mu;&#8052;
&delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigma;&#943;&#8115;
&gamma;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&iota;&kappa;&#8054;
&mu;&#943;&gamma;&nu;&upsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;. A <span
class="pagenum">147</span> mythical belief is a tradition regarding
things which never took place, but were invented, as among others,
the tales about Cronus, for many are led to believe them. A
dogmatic opinion is the acceptance of something that seems to be
established by a course of reasoning, or by some proof, as for
example, that atoms are elements of things, and that they are
either homogeneous, or infinitesimal, or of some other description.
Now we place each of these things sometimes in opposition to
itself, and sometimes in opposition to each one of the others. For
example, we place a <span class="pagenum">148</span> custom in
opposition to a custom thus: some of the Ethiopians tattoo new-born
children, but we do not, and the Persians think it is seemly to
have a garment of many colors and reaching to the feet, but we
think it not so. The Indians &tau;&alpha;&#8150;&sigmaf;
&gamma;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&iota;&xi;&#8054;
&delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigma;&#943;&#8115;
&mu;&#943;&gamma;&nu;&upsilon;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&iota;, but most of
the other nations consider it a shame. We place a law in <span
class="pagenum">149</span> opposition to a law in this way: among
the Romans he who renounces his paternal inheritance does not pay
his father's debts, but among the Rhodians he pays them in any
case; and among the Tauri in Scythia it was a law to offer
strangers in sacrifice to Artemis, but with us it is forbidden to
kill a man near a temple. We place a school <span class=
"pagenum">150</span> in opposition to a school when we oppose the
school of Diogenes to that of Aristippus, or that of the Laconians
to that of the Italians. We place a mythical belief in opposition
to a mythical belief, as by some traditions Jupiter is said to be
the father of men and gods, and by others Oceanus, as we
say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="quote">"Oceanus father of the gods, and Tethys the
mother."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We place dogmatic opinions in opposition to each other, <span
class="pagenum">151</span> when we say that some declare that there
is only one element, but others that they are infinite in number,
and some that the soul is mortal, others that it is immortal; and
some say that our affairs are directed by the providence of the
gods, but others that there is no providence. We <span class=
"pagenum">152</span> place custom in opposition to other things, as
for example to a law, when we say that among the Persians it is the
custom to practice
&#7936;&rho;&rho;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&iota;&xi;&#943;&alpha;&iota;,
but among the Romans it is forbidden by law to do it; by us
adultery is forbidden, but among the Massagetae indifference in
this respect is allowed by custom, as Eudoxos of Cnidus relates in
the first part of his book of travels; among us it is forbidden
&mu;&eta;&tau;&rho;&#940;&sigma;&iota;
&mu;&#943;&gamma;&nu;&upsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;, but
among the Persians it is the custom by preference to marry so; the
Egyptians marry sisters also, which among us is forbidden by law.
Further, <span class="pagenum">153</span> we place a custom in
opposition to a school, when we say that most men
&#7936;&nu;&alpha;&chi;&omega;&rho;&omicron;&#8166;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf;
&mu;&iota;&gamma;&nu;&#973;&omega;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&iota;
&tau;&alpha;&#8150;&sigmaf; &#7953;&alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&#8182;&nu;
&gamma;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&iota;&xi;&#943;&nu;, &#8001;
&delta;&#8050; &Kappa;&rho;&#940;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &tau;&#8135;
&#7993;&pi;&pi;&alpha;&rho;&chi;&#943;&#8115;
&delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigma;&#943;&#8115;, and Diogenes went
around with one shoulder bare, but we go around with our customary
clothes. We place a custom <span class="pagenum">154</span> in
opposition to a mythical belief, as when the myths say that Cronus
ate his own children, while with us it is the custom to take care
of our children; and among us it is the custom to venerate the gods
as good, and not liable to evil, but they are described by the
poets as being wounded, and also as being jealous of each other. We
place a custom in <span class="pagenum">155</span> opposition to a
dogmatic opinion when we say that it is a custom with us to seek
good things from the gods, but that Epicurus says that the divine
pays no heed to us; Aristippus also held it to be a matter of
indifference to wear a woman's robe, but we consider it shameful.
We place a school in <span class="pagenum">156</span> opposition to
a law, as according to the law it is not allowed to beat a free and
noble born man, but the wrestlers and boxers strike each other
according to the teaching of their manner of life, and although
murder is forbidden, the gladiators kill each other for the same
reason. We place <span class="pagenum">157</span> a mythical belief
in opposition to a school when we say that, although the myths say
of Hercules that in company with Omphale&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="quote">"He carded wool, and bore servitude,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and did things that not even an ordinary good man would have
done, yet Hercules' theory of life was noble. We place a mythical
belief in opposition to a dogmatic <span class="pagenum">158</span>
opinion when we say that athletes seeking after glory as a good,
enter for its sake upon a laborious profession, but many
philosophers, on the other hand, teach that glory is worthless. We
place law in opposition to mythical belief <span class=
"pagenum">159</span> when we say the poets represent the gods as
working adultery and sin, but among us the law forbids those
things. We place law in opposition to dogmatic opinion when we say
<span class="pagenum">160</span> that the followers of Chrysippus
hold that it is a matter of indifference to marry one's mother or
sister, but the law forbids these things. We place a mythical
belief in opposition <span class="pagenum">161</span> to a dogmatic
opinion when we say that the poets represent Jupiter as descending
and holding intercourse with mortal women, but the Dogmatics think
this was impossible; also that the poet says that Jupiter, on
account <span class="pagenum">162</span> of his sorrow for
Sarpedon, rained drops of blood upon the earth, but it is a dogma
of the philosophers that the divine is exempt from suffering; and
they deny the myth of the horse-centaurs, giving us the
horse-centaur as an example of non-existence. Now we could give
many other examples <span class="pagenum">163</span> of each of the
antitheses mentioned above, but for a brief argument, these are
sufficient. Since, however, such anomaly of things is shown by this
Trope also, we shall not be able to say what objects are by nature,
but only what each thing appears to be like, according to this or
that school, or this or that law, or this or that custom, or
according to each of the other conditions. Therefore, by this Trope
also, we must suspend our judgment in regard to the nature of
external objects. Thus we arrive at &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;
through the ten Tropes.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Five Tropes.</i></div>

<p>The later Sceptics, however, teach the following five <span
class="pagenum">164</span> Tropes of
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;: first, the one based upon
contradiction; second, the <i>regressus in infinitum</i>; third,
relation; fourth, the hypothetical; fifth, the <i>circulus in
probando</i>. The one <span class="pagenum">165</span> based upon
contradiction is the one from which we find, that in reference to
the thing put before us for investigation, a position has been
developed which is impossible to be judged, either practically, or
theoretically, and therefore, as we are not able to either accept
or reject anything, we end in suspending the judgment. The one
based upon the <span class="pagenum">166</span> <i>regressus in
infinitum</i> is that in which we say that the proof brought
forward for the thing set before us calls for another proof, and
that one another, and so on to infinity, so that, not having
anything from which to begin the reasoning, the suspension of
judgment follows. The one based upon <span class=
"pagenum">167</span> relation, as we have said before, is that one
in which the object appears of this kind or that kind, as related
to the judge and to the things regarded together with it, but we
suspend our judgment as to what it is in reality. The one <span
class="pagenum">168</span> based upon hypothesis is illustrated by
the Dogmatics, when in the <i>regressus in infinitum</i> they begin
from something that they do not found on reason, but which they
simply take for granted without proof. The Trope, <i>circulus in
probando</i>, <span class="pagenum">169</span> arises when the
thing which ought to prove the thing sought for, needs to be
sustained by the thing sought for, and as we are unable to take the
one for the proof of the other, we suspend our judgment in regard
to both. Now we shall briefly show that it is possible to refer
every thing under investigation to one or another of these Tropes,
as follows: the thing before us is either sensible or intellectual;
difference of opinion exists, however, as to what it <span class=
"pagenum">170</span> is in itself, for some say that only the
things of sense are true, others, only those belonging to the
understanding, and others say that some things of sense, and some
of thought, are true. Now, will it be said that this difference of
opinion can be judged or cannot be judged? If it cannot be judged,
then we have the result necessarily of suspension of judgment,
because it is impossible to express opinion in regard to things
about which a difference of opinion exists which cannot be judged.
If it can be judged, then we ask <span class="pagenum">171</span>
how it is to be judged? For example, the sensible, for we shall
limit the argument first to this&mdash;Is it to be judged by
sensible or by intellectual standards? For if it is to be judged by
a sensible one, since we are in doubt about the sensible, that will
also need something else to sustain it; and if that proof is also
something sensible, something else will again be necessary to prove
it, and so on <i>in infinitum</i>. If, on the contrary, the
sensible must be judged by something <span class=
"pagenum">172</span> intellectual, as there is disagreement in
regard to the intellectual, this intellectual thing will require
also judgment and proof. Now, how is it to be proved? If by
something intellectual, it will likewise be thrown into
<i>infinitum</i>; if by something sensible, as the intellectual has
been taken for the proof of the sensible, and the sensible has been
taken for that of the intellectual, the <i>circulus in probando</i>
is introduced. If, however, in order to escape <span class=
"pagenum">173</span> from this, the one who is speaking to us
expects us to take something for granted which has not been proved,
in order to prove what follows, the hypothetical Trope is
introduced, which provides no way of escape. For if the one who
makes the hypothesis is worthy of confidence, we should in every
case be no less worthy of confidence in making a contrary
hypothesis. If the one who makes the assumption assumes something
true, he makes it suspicious by using it as a hypothesis, and not
as an established fact; if it is false, the foundation of the
reasoning is unsound. If a <span class="pagenum">174</span>
hypothesis is any help towards a trustworthy result, let the thing
in question itself be assumed, and not something else, by which,
forsooth, one would establish the thing under discussion. If it is
absurd to assume the thing questioned, it is also absurd to assume
that upon which it rests. That all things belonging to the senses
are also in <span class="pagenum">175</span> relation to something
else is evident, because they are in relation to those who perceive
them. It is clear then, that whatever thing of sense is brought
before us, it may be easily referred to one of the five Tropes. And
we come to a similar conclusion in regard to intellectual things.
For if it should be said that there is a difference of opinion
regarding them which cannot be judged, it will be granted that we
must suspend the judgment concerning it. In <span class=
"pagenum">176</span> case the difference of opinion can be judged,
if it is judged through anything intellectual, we fall into the
<i>regressus in infinitum</i>, and if through anything sensible
into the <i>circulus in probando</i>; for, as the sensible is again
subject to difference of opinion, and cannot be judged by the
sensible on account of the <i>regressus in infinitum</i>, it will
have need of the intellectual, just as the intellectual has need of
the sensible. But he who accepts anything which is hypothetical
again <span class="pagenum">177</span> is absurd. Intellectual
things stand also in relation, because the form in which they are
expressed depends on the mind of the thinker, and, if they were in
reality exactly as they are described, there would not have been
any difference of opinion about them. Therefore the intellectual
also is brought under the five Tropes, and consequently it is
necessary to suspend the judgment altogether with regard to every
thing that is brought before us. Such are the five Tropes taught by
the later Sceptics. They set them forth, not to throw out the ten
Tropes, but in order to put to shame the audacity of the Dogmatics
in a variety of ways, by these Tropes as well as by those.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Two Tropes.</i></div>

<p>Two other Tropes of &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; are also
taught. For as it <span class="pagenum">178</span> appears that
everything that is comprehended is either comprehended through
itself or through something else, it is thought that this fact
introduces doubt in regard to all things. And that nothing can be
understood through itself is evident, it is said, from the
disagreement which exists altogether among the physicists in regard
to sensible and intellectual things. I mean, of course, a
disagreement which cannot be judged, as we are not able to use a
sensible or an intellectual criterion in judging it, for everything
that we would take has a part in the disagreement, and is
untrustworthy. Nor is it conceded that anything can be <span class=
"pagenum">179</span> comprehended through something else; for if a
thing is comprehended through something, that must always in turn
be comprehended through something else, and the <i>regressus in
infinitum</i> or the <i>circulus in probando</i> follow. If, on the
contrary, a thing is comprehended through something that one wishes
to use as if it had been comprehended through itself, this is
opposed to the fact that nothing can be comprehended through
itself, according to what we have said. We do not know how that
which contradicts itself can be comprehended, either through itself
or through something else, as no criterion of the truth or of
comprehension appears, and signs without proof would be rejected,
as we shall see in the next book. So much will suffice for the
present about suspension of judgment.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>What are the Tropes for the overturning of
Aetiology?</i></div>

<p>In the same manner as we teach the Tropes of
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;, <span class="pagenum">180</span>
some set forth Tropes through which we oppose the Dogmatics, by
expressing doubt in regard to the aetiology of which they are
especially proud. So Aenesidemus teaches eight Tropes, by which he
thinks that he can prove all the dogmatic aetiology useless. The
first of these Tropes, <span class="pagenum">181</span> he said,
relates to the character of aetiology in general, which does not
give incontestable testimony in regard to phenomena, because it
treats of unseen things. The second Trope states that although
abundant resources exist by which to investigate the cause of a
thing in question, some Dogmatics investigate it in one way only.
The third Trope <span class="pagenum">182</span> states that the
Dogmatics assign causes which do not show any order for things
which have taken place in an orderly manner. The fourth Trope
states that the Dogmatics, accepting phenomena as they take place,
think that they also understand how unseen things take place,
although perhaps the unseen things have taken place in the same way
as the phenomena, and perhaps in some other way peculiar to
themselves. The fifth Trope states that they <span class=
"pagenum">183</span> all, so to speak, assign causes according to
their own hypotheses about the elements, but not according to any
commonly accepted methods. The sixth states that they often explain
things investigated according to their own hypotheses, but ignore
opposing hypotheses which have equal probability. The seventh
states that they often give <span class="pagenum">184</span>
reasons for things that not only conflict with phenomena, but also
with their own hypotheses. The eighth states that although that
which seems manifest, and that which is to be investigated, are
often equally inscrutable, they build up a theory from the one
about the other, although both are equally inscrutable. It is not
impossible, Aenesidemus <span class="pagenum">185</span> said also,
that some Dogmatics should fail in their theories of causality from
other combinations of reasons deducible from the Tropes given
above. Perhaps also the five Tropes of
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; are sufficient to refute aetiology,
for he who proposes a cause will propose one which is either in
harmony with all the sects of philosophy, with Scepticism, and with
phenomena, or one that is not. Perhaps, however, it is not possible
that a cause should be in harmony with them, for phenomena and
unknown things altogether disagree with each other. If it is not in
harmony with them, the <span class="pagenum">186</span> reason of
this will also be demanded of the one who proposed it; and if he
accepts a phenomenon as the cause of a phenomenon, or something
unknown as the cause of the unknown, he will be thrown into the
<i>regressus in infinitum</i>; if he uses one cause to account for
another one, into the <i>circulus in probando</i>; but if he stops
anywhere, he will either say that the cause that he proposes holds
good so far as regards the things that have been said, and
introduce relation, abolishing an absolute standpoint; or if he
accepts anything by hypothesis, he will be attacked by us.
Therefore it is perhaps possible to put the temerity of the
Dogmatics to shame in aetiology by these Tropes.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Sceptical Formulae.</i></div>

<p>When we use any one of these Tropes, or the Tropes of <span
class="pagenum">187</span> &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;, we
employ with them certain formulae which show the Sceptical method
and our own feeling, as for instance, the sayings, "No more," "One
must determine nothing," and certain others. It is fitting
therefore to treat of these in this place. Let us begin with "No
more."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Formula "No more."</i></div>

<p>We sometimes express this as I have given it, and <span class=
"pagenum">188</span> sometimes thus, "Nothing more." For we do not
accept the "No more," as some understand it, for the examination of
the special, and "Nothing more" for that of the general, but we use
"No more" and "Nothing more" without any difference, and we shall
at present treat of them as one and the same expression. Now this
formula is defective, for as when we say a double one we really
mean a double garment, and when we say a broad one we really mean a
broad road; so when we say "No more" we mean really no more than
this, or in every way the same. But some <span class=
"pagenum">189</span> of the Sceptics use instead of the
interrogation "No?" the interrogation "What, this rather than
this?" using the word "what" in the sense of "what is the reason,"
so that the formula means, "What is the reason for this rather than
for this?" It is a customary thing, however, to use an
interrogation instead of a statement, as "Who of the mortals does
not know the wife of Jupiter?" and also to use a statement instead
of an interrogation, as "I seek where Dion dwells," and "I ask why
one should admire a poet." The word "what" is also used instead of
"what for" by Menander&mdash;"(For) what did I remain behind?" The
formula "Not more this than this" expresses our own <span class=
"pagenum">190</span> condition of mind, and signifies that because
of the equality of the things that are opposed to each other we
finally attain to a state of equilibrium of soul. We mean by
equality that equality which appears to us as probable, by things
placed in opposition to each other we mean simply things which
conflict with each other, and by a state of equilibrium we mean a
state in which we do not assent to one thing more than to another.
Even if the formula <span class="pagenum">191</span> "Nothing more"
seems to express assent or denial, we do not use it so, but we use
it loosely, and not with accuracy, either instead of an
interrogation or instead of saying, "I do not know to which of
these I would assent, and to which I would not." What lies before
us is to express what appears to us, but we are indifferent to the
words by which we express it. This must be understood, however,
that we use the formula "Nothing more" without affirming in regard
to it that it is wholly sure and true, but we present it as it
appears to us.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Aphasia.</i></div>

<p>We explain Aphasia as follows: The word
&phi;&#940;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf; is used <span class=
"pagenum">192</span> in two ways, having a general and a special
signification. According to the general signification, it expresses
affirmation or negation, as "It is day" or "It is not day";
according to the special signification, it expresses an affirmation
only, and negations are not called
&phi;&#940;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;. Now Aphasia is the
opposite of &phi;&#940;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf; in its general
signification, which, as we said, comprises both affirmation and
negation. It follows that Aphasia is a condition of mind, according
to which we say that we neither affirm nor deny anything. It is
evident from this that we do not understand by <span class=
"pagenum">193</span> Aphasia something that inevitably results from
the nature of things, but we mean that we now find ourselves in the
condition of mind expressed by it in regard to the things that are
under investigation. It is necessary to remember that we do not say
that we affirm or deny any of those things that are dogmatically
stated in regard to the unknown, for we yield assent only to those
things which affect our feelings and oblige us to assent to
them.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>"Perhaps," and "It is possible," and "It may
be."</i></div>

<p>The formulae "Perhaps," and "Perhaps not," and "It <span class=
"pagenum">194</span> is possible," and "It is not possible," and
"It may be," and "It may not be," we use instead of "Perhaps it
is," and "Perhaps it is not," and "It is possible that it is," and
"It is possible that it is not," and "It may be that it is," and
"It may be that it is not." That is, we use the formula "It is not
possible" for the sake of brevity, instead of saying "It is not
possible to be," and "It may not be" instead of "It may not be that
it is," and "Perhaps not" instead of "Perhaps it is not." Again, we
do not here dispute <span class="pagenum">195</span> about words,
neither do we question if the formulae mean these things
absolutely, but we use them loosely, as I said before. Yet I think
it is evident that these formulae express Aphasia. For certainly
the formula "Perhaps it is" really includes that which seems to
contradict it, <i>i.e.</i> the formula "Perhaps it is not," because
it does not affirm in in regard to anything that it is really so.
It is the same also in regard to the others.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; or the
Suspension of Judgment.</i></div>

<p>When I say that I suspend my judgment, I mean that <span class=
"pagenum">196</span> I cannot say which of those things presented
should be believed, and which should not be believed, showing that
things appear equal to me in respect to trustworthiness and
untrustworthiness. Now we do not affirm that they are equal, but we
state what appears to us in regard to them at the time when they
present themselves to us. &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; means the
holding back of the opinion, so as neither to affirm nor deny
anything because of the equality of the things in question.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Formula "I determine Nothing."</i></div>

<p>In regard to the formula "I determine nothing," we <span class=
"pagenum">197</span> say the following: By "determine" we mean, not
simply to speak, but to give assent to an affirmation with regard
to some unknown thing. For it will soon be found that the Sceptic
determines nothing, not even the formula "I determine nothing," for
this formula is not a dogmatic opinion, that is an assent to
something unknown, but an expression declaring what our condition
of mind is. When, for example, the Sceptic says, "I determine
nothing," he means this: "According to my present feeling I can
assert or deny nothing dogmatically regarding the things under
investigation," and in saying this he expresses what appears to him
in reference to the things under discussion. He does not express
himself positively, but he states what he feels.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Formula "Every thing is
Undetermined."</i></div>

<p>The expression "Indetermination" furthermore shows <span class=
"pagenum">198</span> a state of mind in which we neither deny nor
affirm positively anything regarding things that are investigated
in a dogmatic way, that is the things that are unknown. When then
the Sceptic says "Every thing is undetermined," he uses "is
undetermined," in the sense of "it appears undetermined to him."
The words "every thing" do not mean all existences, but those that
he has examined of the unknown things that are investigated by the
Dogmatists. By "undetermined," he means that there is no preference
in the things that are placed in opposition to each other, or that
they simply conflict with each other in respect to trustworthiness
or untrustworthiness. And as the one <span class=
"pagenum">199</span> who says "I am walking" really means "It is I
that am walking," so he who says "Every thing is undetermined"
means at the same time, according to our teachings, "as far as I am
concerned," or "as it appears to me," as if he were saying "As far
as I have examined the things that are under investigation in a
dogmatic manner, it appears to me that no one of them excels the
one which conflicts with it in trustworthiness or
untrustworthiness."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Formula "Every thing is
Incomprehensible."</i></div>

<p>We treat the formula "Every thing is incomprehensible" <span
class="pagenum">200</span> in the same way. For "every thing" we
interpret in the same way as above, and we supply the words "to me"
so that what we say is this: "As far as I have inspected the
unknown things which are dogmatically examined, it appears to me
that every thing is incomprehensible." This is not, however, to
affirm that the things which are examined by the Dogmatists are of
such a nature as to be necessarily incomprehensible, but one
expresses his own feeling in saying "I see that I have not thus far
comprehended any of those things because of the equilibrium of the
things that are placed in opposition to each other." Whence it
seems to me that every thing that has been brought forward to
dispute our formulae has fallen wide of the mark.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Formulae "I do not comprehend" and "I do
not understand."</i></div>

<p>The formulae "I do not comprehend" and "I do not <span class=
"pagenum">201</span> understand" show a condition of mind in which
the Sceptic stands aloof for the present from asserting or denying
anything in regard to the unknown things under investigation, as is
evident from what we said before about the other formulae.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The Formula "To place an equal Statement in
opposition to every Statement."</i></div>

<p>Furthermore, when we say "Every statement may have <span class=
"pagenum">202</span> an equal statement placed in opposition to
it," by "every," we mean all the statements that we have examined;
we do not use the word "statement" simply, but for a statement
which seeks to prove something dogmatically about things that are
unknown, and not at all one that shows a process of reasoning from
premises and conclusions, but something which is put together in
any sort of way. We use the word "equal" in reference to
trustworthiness or untrustworthiness. "Is placed in opposition" we
use instead of the common expression "to conflict with," and we
supply "as it appears to me." When therefore <span class=
"pagenum">203</span> one says, "It seems to me that every statement
which I have examined, which proves something dogmatically, may
have another statement placed in opposition to it which also proves
something dogmatically, and which is equal to it in trustworthiness
and untrustworthiness," this is not asserted dogmatically, but is
an expression of human feeling as it appears to the one who feels
it. Some <span class="pagenum">204</span> Sceptics express the
formula as follows: "Every statement should have an equal one
placed in opposition to it," demanding it authoritatively thus:
"Let us place in opposition to every statement that proves
something dogmatically another conflicting statement which also
seeks to prove something dogmatically, and is equal to it in
trustworthiness and untrustworthiness." Naturally this is directed
to the Sceptics, but the infinitive should be used instead of the
imperative, that is, "to oppose" instead of "let us oppose." This
formula is recommended to the <span class="pagenum">205</span>
Sceptic, lest he should be deceived by the Dogmatists and give up
his investigations, and rashly fail of the
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; which is thought
to accompany &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; in regard to
everything, as we have explained above.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>General Observations on the Formulae of the
Sceptics.</i></div>

<p>We have treated of a sufficient number of these formulae <span
class="pagenum">206</span> for an outline, especially since what we
have said about those mentioned applies also to others that we have
omitted. In regard to all the Sceptical formulae, it must be
understood in advance that we do not affirm them to be absolutely
true, because we say that they can even refute themselves, since
they are themselves included in those things to which they refer,
just as cathartic medicines not only purge the body of humors, but
carry off themselves with the humors. We say then that we use these
formulae, <span class="pagenum">207</span> not as literally making
known the things for which they are used, but loosely, and if one
wishes, inaccurately. It is not fitting for the Sceptic to dispute
about words, especially as it contributes to our purpose to say
that these formulae have no absolute meaning; their meaning is a
relative one, that is, relative to the Sceptics. Besides, <span
class="pagenum">208</span> it is to be remembered that we do not
say them about all things in general, but about the unknown, and
things that are dogmatically investigated, and that we say what
appears to us, and that we do not express ourselves decidedly about
the nature of external objects. By this means I think that every
sophism brought against the Sceptical formulae can be overturned.
We have now shown the character of <span class="pagenum">209</span>
Scepticism by examining its idea, its parts, its criterion and aim,
and also the Tropes of &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;, and by
treating of the Sceptical formulae. We think it therefore
appropriate to enter briefly into the distinction between
Scepticism and the nearly related schools of philosophy in order to
more clearly understand the Sceptical School. We will begin with
the philosophy of Heraclitus.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>In what does the Sceptical School differ
from the Philosophy of Heraclitus?</i></div>

<p>Now that this school differs from ours is evident, for <span
class="pagenum">210</span> Heraclitus expresses himself about many
unknown things dogmatically, which we do not, as has been said.
Aenesidemus and his followers said that the Sceptical School is the
way to the philosophy of Heraclitus. They gave as a reason for this
that the statement that contradictory predicates appear to be
applicable to the same thing, leads the way to the statement that
contradictory predicates are in reality applicable to the same
thing; and as the Sceptics say that contradictory predicates appear
to be applicable to the same thing, the Heraclitans proceed from
this to the doctrine that such predicates are in reality
applicable. We reply to this that the statement that contradictory
predicates appear to be applicable to the same thing is not a dogma
of the Sceptics, but is a fact that presents itself not only to the
Sceptics, but to other philosophers, and to all men. No one, for
instance, would venture to say that <span class=
"pagenum">211</span> honey does not taste sweet to those in health,
and bitter to those who have the jaundice, so that the Heraclitans
start from a preconception common to all men, as do we also, and
perhaps the other schools of philosophy likewise. If, however, they
had attributed the origin of the statement that contradictory
predicates are present in the same thing to any of the Sceptical
teachings, as, for example, to the formula "Every thing is
incomprehensible," or "I determine nothing," or any of the other
similar ones, it may be that which they say would follow; but since
they start from that which is a common experience, not only to us,
but to other philosophers, and in life, why should one say that our
school is a path to the philosophy of Heraclitus more than any of
the other schools of philosophy, or than life itself, as we all
make use of the same subject matter? On the other hand, the
Sceptical School may not <span class="pagenum">212</span> only fail
to help towards the knowledge of the philosophy of Heraclitus, but
may even hinder it! For the Sceptic attacks all the dogmas of
Heraclitus as having been rashly given, and opposes on the one hand
the doctrine of conflagration, and on the other, the doctrine that
contradictory predicates in reality apply to the same thing, and in
regard to every dogma of Heraclitus he scorns his dogmatic
rashness, and then, in the manner that I have before referred to,
adduces the formulae "I do not understand" and "I determine
nothing," which conflict with the Heraclitan doctrines. It is
absurd to say that this conflicting school is a path to the very
sect with which it conflicts. It is then absurd to say that the
Sceptical School is a path to the philosophy of Heraclitus.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>In what does the Sceptical School differ
from the Philosophy of Democritus?</i></div>

<p>The philosophy of Democritus is also said to have <span class=
"pagenum">213</span> community with Scepticism, because it seems to
use the same matter that we do. For, from the fact that honey seems
sweet to some and bitter to others, Democritus reasons, it is said,
that honey is neither sweet nor bitter, and therefore he accords
with the formula "No more," which is a formula of the Sceptics. But
the Sceptics and the Democritans use the formula "No more"
differently from each other, for they emphasise the negation in the
expression, but we, the not knowing whether both of the phenomena
exist or neither one, and so we differ in this respect. The
distinction, however, becomes most evident when <span class=
"pagenum">214</span> Democritus says that atoms and empty space are
real, for by real he means existing in reality. Now, although he
begins with the anomaly in phenomena, yet, since he says that atoms
and empty space really exist, it is superfluous, I think, even to
say that he differs from us.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>In what does Scepticism differ from the
Cyrenaic Philosophy?</i></div>

<p>Some say that the Cyrenaic School is the same as the <span
class="pagenum">215</span> Sceptical, because that school also
claims to comprehend only conditions of mind. It differs, however,
from it, because, while the former makes pleasure and the gentle
motion of the flesh its aim, we make
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha; ours, and this is
opposed to the aim of their school. For whether pleasure is present
or not, confusion awaits him who maintains that pleasure is an aim,
as I have shown in what I said about the aim. And then, in
addition, we suspend our judgment as far as the reasoning with
regard to external objects is concerned, but the Cyrenaics
pronounce the nature of these inscrutable.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>In what does Scepticism differ from the
Philosophy of Protagoras?</i></div>

<p>Protagoras makes man the measure of all things, of <span class=
"pagenum">216</span> things that are that they are, and things that
are not that they are not, meaning by measure, criterion, and by
things, events, that is to say really, man is the criterion for all
events, of things that are that they are, and of things that are
not that they are not. And for that reason he accepts only the
phenomena that appear to each man, and thus he introduces relation.
Therefore he seems to have community <span class=
"pagenum">217</span> with the Pyrrhoneans. He differs, however,
from them, and we shall see the difference after we have somewhat
explained how things seemed to Protagoras. He says, for example,
that matter is fluid, and as it flows, additions are constantly
made in the place of that which is carried away; the perceptions
also are arranged anew and changed, according to the age and
according to other conditions of the body. He says also, that the
reasons of all phenomena <span class="pagenum">218</span> are
present in matter, so that matter can be all that it appears to be
to all men as far as its power is concerned. Men, however,
apprehend differently at different times, according to the
different conditions that they are in; for he that is in a natural
condition will apprehend those qualities in matter that can appear
to those who are in a <span class="pagenum">219</span> natural
condition, while on the contrary, those who are in an unnatural
condition will apprehend those qualities that can appear to the
abnormal. Furthermore, the same reasoning would hold true in regard
to differences in age, to sleeping and waking, and each of the
other different conditions. Therefore man becomes the criterion of
things that are, for all things that appear to men exist for men,
and those things that do not appear to any one among men do not
exist. We see that he dogmatises in saying that matter is fluid,
and also in saying that the reasons for all phenomena have their
foundation in matter, while these things are unknown, and to us are
things regarding which we suspend our judgment.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>In what does Scepticism differ from the
Academic Philosophy?</i></div>

<p>Some say further that the Academic philosophy is the <span
class="pagenum">220</span> same as Scepticism, therefore it seems
appropriate to me to treat of that also. There have been, as the
most say, three Academies&mdash;the most ancient one, that of Plato
and his followers; the second and middle one, that of Arcesilaus
and his followers, Arcesilaus being the pupil of Polemo; the third
and new Academy, that of Carneades and Clitomachus and their
followers; some add also a fourth, that of Philo and Charmides, and
their followers; and some count even a fifth, that of Antiochus and
his followers. Beginning then from the old Academy, let us consider
the difference between the schools of philosophy mentioned. Now
some have <span class="pagenum">221</span> said that Plato was a
Dogmatic, others that he was a Sceptic, and others that he was in
some things a Sceptic and in some things a Dogmatic. For in the
fencing dialogues, where Socrates is introduced as either making
sport of someone or contending against the Sophists, Plato has,
they say, a fencing and sceptical character, but he is dogmatic
when he expresses himself seriously, either through Socrates or
Timaeus or any such person. In <span class="pagenum">222</span>
regard to those who say that he is a Dogmatic, or a Dogmatic in
some things and a Sceptic in others, it would be superfluous, it
seems to me, to speak now, for they themselves grant that he is
different from us. The question as to whether he was really a
Sceptic or not we treat more fully in the Memoranda, but here we
state briefly that according to Menodotus and Aenesidemus (for
these especially defended this position) Plato dogmatises when he
expresses himself regarding ideas, and regarding the existence of
Providence, and when he states that the virtuous life is more to be
chosen than the one of vice. If he assents to these things as true,
he dogmatises; or even if he accepts them as more probable than
otherwise he departs from the sceptical character, since he gives a
preference to one thing above another in trustworthiness or
untrustworthiness; for how foreign this is to us is evident from
what we have said before. Even if when <span class=
"pagenum">223</span> he performs mental gymnastics, as they say, he
expresses some things sceptically, he is not because of this a
Sceptic. For he who dogmatises about one thing, or, in short, gives
preference to one mental image over another in trustworthiness or
untrustworthiness in respect to anything that is unknown, is a
Dogmatic in character, as Timon shows by what he said of
Xenophanes. For after having <span class="pagenum">224</span>
praised Xenophanes in many things, and even after having dedicated
his Satires to him, he made him mourn and say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="quote">"Would that I also might gain that mind
profound,</div>

<div class="i0">Able to look both ways. In a treacherous path have
I been decoyed,</div>

<div class="i0">And still in old age am with all wisdom
unwed.</div>

<div class="i0">For wherever I turned my view</div>

<div class="i0">All things were resolved into unity; all things,
alway</div>

<div class="i0">From all sources drawn, were merged into nature the
same."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Timon calls him somewhat, but not entirely, free from vanity,
when he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="quote">"Xenophanes somewhat free from vanity, mocker of
Homeric deceit,</div>

<div class="i0">Far from men he conceived a god, on all sides
equal,</div>

<div class="i0">Above pain, a being spiritualised, or
intellect."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In saying that he was somewhat free from vanity, he meant that
he was in some things free from vanity. He called him a mocker of
the Homeric deceit because he had scoffed at the deceit in Homer.
Xenophanes also dogmatised, contrary <span class=
"pagenum">225</span> to the assumptions of other men, that all
things are one, and that God is grown together with all things,
that He is spherical, insensible, unchangeable, and reasonable,
whence the difference of Xenophanes from us is easily proved. In
short, from what has been said, it is evident that although Plato
expresses doubt about some things, so long as he has expressed
himself in certain places in regard to the existence of unknown
things, or as preferring some things to others in trustworthiness,
he cannot be, it seems to me, a Sceptic. Those of the New Academy,
although <span class="pagenum">226</span> they say that all things
are incomprehensible, differ from the Sceptics, perhaps even in
saying that all things are incomprehensible (for they assert
decidedly in regard to this, but the Sceptic thinks it possible
that some things may be comprehended), but they differ evidently
still further from us in their judgment of good and evil. For the
Academicians say that there is such a thing as good and evil, not
as we say it, but more with the conviction that that which they
call good exists than that it does not; and likewise in regard to
the evil, while we do not say anything is good or evil with the
conviction that it is probably so, but we live our lives in an
unprejudiced way in order not to be inactive. Moreover, we say that
our ideas are equal to <span class="pagenum">227</span> each other
in trustworthiness and untrustworthiness, as far as their nature
goes, while they say that some are probable and others improbable.
They make a difference also between the improbable ones, for they
believe that some of them are only probable, others probable and
undisputed, still others probable, undisputed, and tested. As for
example, when a coiled rope is lying in a somewhat dark room, he
who comes in suddenly gets only a probable idea of it, and thinks
that it is a serpent; but it appears to <span class=
"pagenum">228</span> be a rope to him who has looked carefully
around, and found out that it does not move, and that it is of such
a color, and so on, according to an idea which is probable and
undisputed. The tested idea is like this: It is said that Hercules
led Alcestis after she was dead back again from Hades and showed
her to Admetus, and he received an idea that was probable and
undisputed regarding Alcestis. As, however, he knew that she was
dead, his mind drew back from belief and inclined to disbelief. Now
those belonging to the New Academy prefer the idea <span class=
"pagenum">229</span> which is probable and undisputed to the simply
probable one. To both of these, however, they prefer that which is
probable, undisputed, and tested. If, however, both those of the
Academy and the Sceptics say that they believe certain things,
there is an evident difference between the two schools of
philosophy even in this; for "to believe" is <span class=
"pagenum">230</span> used in a different sense, meaning, on the one
hand, not to resist, but simply to accept without strong
inclination and approval, as the child is said to believe the
teacher; on the other hand, "to believe" is used to signify
assenting to something with choice, and, as it were, with the
sympathy that accompanies strong will, as the prodigal follows the
one who chooses to live a luxurious life. Therefore, since
Carneades, Clitomachus, and their followers say that they are
strongly inclined to believe that a thing is probable, and we
simply allow that it may be so without assent, we differ <span
class="pagenum">231</span> from them, I think, in this way. We
differ from the New Academy likewise in things concerning the aim;
for while the men who say that they govern themselves according to
that School avail themselves of the idea of the probable in life,
we live according to the laws and customs, and our natural
feelings, in an unprejudiced way. We could say more regarding the
distinction between the two schools if we did not aim at brevity.
Nevertheless, Arcesilaus, who <span class="pagenum">232</span> as
we said was the leader and chief of the Middle Academy, seems to me
to have very much in common with the Pyrrhonean teachings, so that
his school and ours are almost one. For neither does one find that
he expressed an opinion about the existence or non-existence of
anything, nor does he prefer one thing to another as regards
trustworthiness or untrustworthiness; he suspends his judgment
regarding all things, and the aim of his philosophy is
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942;, which is accompanied by
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&xi;&#943;&alpha;, and this agrees
with what we have said. But he calls the <span class=
"pagenum">233</span> particular instances of
&#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; <i>bona</i>, and the particular
instances of assent <i>mala</i>. The difference is that we say
these things according to what appears to us, and not
affirmatively, while he says them as if speaking of realities, that
is, he says that &#7952;&pi;&omicron;&chi;&#942; is in itself good,
and assent an evil. If we are to believe also the things that are
said about him, <span class="pagenum">234</span> he appeared at
first sight to be a Pyrrhonean, but he was in truth a Dogmatic, for
he used to test his companions by the method of doubt to see
whether they were gifted enough to take in Plato's dogmas, so that
he appeared to be a Sceptic, but at the same time he communicated
the doctrines of Plato to those of his companions who were gifted.
Hence Ariston also said about him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="quote">"Plato in front, Pyrrhon behind, Diodorus in the
middle,"</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>because he availed himself of the dialectic of Diodorus, but was
wholly a Platonist. Now Philo and his followers say <span class=
"pagenum">235</span> that as far as the Stoic criterion is
concerned, that is to say the
&phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&#943;&alpha;
&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&lambda;&eta;&pi;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#942;,
things are incomprehensible, but as far as the nature of things is
concerned, they are comprehensible. Antiochus, however, transferred
the Stoa to the Academy, so that it was even said of him that he
taught the Stoic philosophy in the Academy, because he tried to
show that the Stoic doctrines are found in Plato. The difference,
therefore, between the Sceptical School and the Fourth and Fifth
Academy is evident.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>Is Empiricism in Medicine the same as
Scepticism?</i></div>

<p>Some say that the medical sect called Empiricism is <span class=
"pagenum">236</span> the same as Scepticism. Yet the fact must be
recognised, that even if Empiricism does maintain the impossibility
of knowledge, it is neither Scepticism itself, nor would it suit
the Sceptic to take that sect upon himself. He could rather, it
seems to me, belong to the so-called Methodic School. For this
alone, of all the medical sects, does not <span class=
"pagenum">237</span> seem to proceed rashly in regard to unknown
things, and does not presume to say whether they are comprehensible
or not, but is guided by phenomena, and receives from them the same
help which they seem to give to the Sceptical system. For we have
said in what has gone before, that the every-day life which the
Sceptic lives is of four parts, depending on the guidance of
nature, on the necessity of the feelings, on the traditions of laws
and customs, and on the teaching of the arts. Now as by necessity
of <span class="pagenum">238</span> the feelings the Sceptic is led
by thirst to drink, and by hunger to food, and to supply similar
needs in the same way, so also the physician of the Methodic School
is led by the feelings to find suitable remedies; in constipation
he produces a relaxation, as one takes refuge in the sun from the
shrinking on account of intense cold; he is led by a flux to the
stopping of it, as those in a hot bath who are dripping from a
profuse perspiration and are relaxed, hasten to check it by going
into the cold air. Moreover, it is evident that the Methodic
physician forces those things which are of a foreign nature to
adapt themselves to their own nature, as even the dog tries to get
a sharp stick out that is thrust into him. In order, however, that
<span class="pagenum">239</span> I should not overstep the outline
character of this work by discussing details, I think that all the
things that the Methodics have thus said can be classified as
referring to the necessity of the feelings that are natural or
those that are unnatural. Besides this, it is common to both
schools to have no dogmas, and to use words loosely. For as the
<span class="pagenum">240</span> Sceptic uses the formula "I
determine nothing," and "I understand nothing," as we said above,
so the Methodic also uses the expressions "Community," and "To go
through," and other similar ones without over much care. In a
similar way he uses the word "Indication" undogmatically, meaning
that the symptoms of the patient either natural or unnatural,
indicate the remedies that would be suitable, as we said in
speaking of thirst, hunger, and other things. It will thus be seen
that the Methodic <span class="pagenum">241</span> School of
medicine has a certain relationship to Scepticism which is closer
than that of the other medical sects, speaking comparatively if not
absolutely from these and similar tokens. Having said so much in
reference to the schools that seem to closely resemble Scepticism,
we conclude the general consideration of Scepticism and the First
Book of the Sketches.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
